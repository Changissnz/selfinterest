# Self-Interest 

The uniqueness of all philosophies of self-interest are but 
a fraction of any other. In more words, that is because this 
kind of philosophy is not self-contained, instead required to 
extract and derive knowledge from other fields of the natural 
and social sciences alike, in order to put things into practice. 
Because self-interest can only be realized through personal practice, 
only the theory and the theoretics of the totality can be understood 
beforehand, and the self as a finite spatiotemporal concept can 
self-derive a petty fraction of the theory and theoretics. Specific 
fractions of the theory and theoretics are selected by the self-interested 
based on their preferences. This, in and of itself, is a form of 
prejudice. Moreover, the field of self-interest can never reach the 
fundamental low level of abstraction because it is one based on the 
utility of available choice, essentially economics in the individualistic 
sense, and the utility is always centered around the self.

The philosophy of self-interest is one that leans towards the 
private and privatization of value. Every philosopher must have 
reached their destinations in mind and body through the will, the 
fuel for self-interest to take place. Instead of fostering the language 
of general truth for the universal understanding, the philosophy of 
self-interest instead takes direction from the general truth to the 
self for the self, and also from the specific truth to that same self 
for that same self. So that is one key difference between these two 
categories of philosophers, although the philosopher that does not 
proselytize self-interest may actually be working for a collective 
interest that they think greatly benefits their self-interest. In the 
general sense, the lines involved in dualities that are then arbitrarily 
interpreted by the mind as “hard” or “soft” lines make the philosopher 
and their morality better understood by their craft of philosophy, not 
by the benefits bestowed onto them because of their craft. But one that 
is a philosopher is not strictly one of that one role.

Not to discredit the category of self-interest as a philosophy, 
but this kind of philosophy indeed serves defeatist purposes to 
the “love of wisdom", philosophy, if the assumption of “love” or 
“wisdom” having to be shared is the default requirement for a field 
to be called a class of philosophy. Self-interest also carries 
connotations of independence, liberty, and autonomy, which then 
subjects the rules and beliefs found in knowledge under the self-interested 
for their existence and decision-making. Philosophies of self-interest, 
when taught, causes the glorification of the individual. And since the 
human being arguably has a tendency to already be self-justifying, this 
tendency going all the way down to the biological immune system, there 
is a limit to how much the self can further their understanding by directly 
tending to the self by the internal means of the self. These philosophies 
cannot grow in and of themselves, only serving as backgrounds of reminder 
to encourage the individual past the general that bounds all under it.

Technical difficulties exist in the usage of natural language to explain 
philosophies of self-interest. For one thing, what is the self from one 
to another? When one thinks that their self somehow can be comprised by 
thoughts of the external, such as others’ selves, that is when the “self” 
in self-interest is no longer a direct line from the external projection 
of one to their internal workings. It is possible for one to inflate their 
notion of their self to include the lives of others, for that one to claim 
they know what is best for the other that is part of their conceptualization 
of their self, in turn morphing the understanding of self-interest as what 
suits the individual to what suits the individual and their people. Economics 
play a fundamentally great role in self-interest. If what is best for a 
specific individual is best for the common good, then what is self versus 
collective interests? Unfortunately for the language of ideals in explaining 
the interests of sentient beings, there are inevitable clashes and mergers 
between the self separated from the remaining world and the self alongside 
other selves in the same world.

Philosophies of self-interest have a murky aura in their teaching and 
interpretation. The phrasing, “murky aura”, is carefully selected to describe 
the kind of replicability and factuality in fields that desire to translate 
the subjective into the objective, that is, the formulated solution that the 
practitioner of self-interest wishes to use. This translation of the subjective 
to the objective is done primarily by the practitioner. And the teacher of 
self-interest to the student educates by means not entirely forward (murky). 
Suppose self-interest to be a vital metaphysical aspect of every being. The 
teacher has the question of putting full effort into educating the student on 
the teacher’s conceptualization of the self that is then supposed to be used 
by the student. The student, on the other hand, has the question to take as 
truth or fallacy any of the teacher’s educative statements on how they should 
nurture their own self-interest. It cannot be factually stated that only 
philosophical educations of self-interest can serve the great purpose for 
continuing legacy. Legacy is a cousin of the lone “self”, separated by degrees 
minor or major based on the lone self’s measure of accepting the historicism 
purportedly connected to them. One that proselytizes philosophy may use the 
language, poetics, and other communicative devices that give off the impression 
of no disproportional interest from their self for their self. Attempts to build 
a rational framework of expectations for students from each school of philosophy 
may very well be folly, especially in terms of self-interest, one that rests on 
the concept of “choice” more so than “obligation”.

The use of self-interest for one’s purpose always rests on systems, 
axiomatic principles pieced together for at least a metaphysical construct 
of reference. Attempting to teach another what is self-interest rests on the 
principle that can be expressed as, “do what you think or feel fit”. This 
expression uses loose wording, and opens rational-like pathways for moral 
relativism, a paradigm of thought that is not entirely confined to the truths 
of the fundamental, and is thus not at the same centrality of truth as 
fundamental philosophy that can produce the precision of science. Many will 
argue that philosophy and ethics can be one and the same, but this is a 
misconception that has led many down very regrettable roads. Here is a 
convention: there is philosophy, then mathematics, then physics, chemistry, 
and biology. Many fields past biology, then there is ethics. So those that 
claim philosophy and ethics can be one and the same must either believe that 
their view on ethics is true enough right down to the philosophical level, 
thus negating any social opposition to their view of ethics, or they must 
abide by the fundamental in expressing their views in the social context, 
this abidement granting them the liberty of not having to pose and advance 
opinion or preference as truth for the proper mannerisms of ethics. The 
default setting of self-interest being dependent on existing systems, as 
initially mentioned, means that abstract language to teach one on self-interest 
cannot start with interests of the self without the relation to something other. 
The focus on the self as an internalist construct is more so about independent 
maintenance and development, but both of these independent objectives depend 
on existing systems of methodology and material, as well. Abstracting the 
concept of the “self” for expression of these notions’ truths to another 
has shortfalls in specificities. The abstract can never capture the entire 
meaning of the “self” in a universal and thorough manner, without the “self” 
having to be the one responsible for induction to suit their specific forms 
and movements.

A posit on self-interest that cannot be proven wrong, no matter how unlike 
the fundamental truth it may be interpreted as, is that communicating to another 
a conceptualization of the “self” that they should adhere to is already at least 
one mark off from the centrality of the “self”. It is like the difference between 
any 0 and any 1; there is a space of 1 in between the two. Another posit, of a 
plausible nature, is that communication of a conceptualization of self-interest 
is not precisely about the merging of the “self” with “interest”, instead about 
the practice of self-interest, not about exactly one of the “self” or “interest”. 
The “self” should tend to their “interest”, not to something other than their 
“interest”. But there is a separation in meaning and existence between the “self” 
and the “interest”, the “interest” only being labeled this term due to factors 
that include the propensity of the “self” for it. The “self” can be influenced in 
ways, foreign to their bare state, to develop an interest for something that 
otherwise would not have occurred. Even in terms of the “self” without the 
influencer, at least a communicator if not an accepted educator, the “self” 
is not bound to a steadfast guarantee of conceptualizing their “self” in the 
same representation for all contexts. Compare notions of self-interest, these 
notions representing one or more philosophies of self-interest, with other 
abstract fields of thought. In these other fields of thought, the “self” can 
put aside their conscious conceptualization of their “self” to comprehend those 
understandings for replication or constructive utilization. But with the “self”, 
there are comprehensions of the comprehensions from the “self”, and comprehensions 
of the image projected from the “self”, and comprehensions of alternative ways of 
expression, alternative images, for the “self” to project their “self” by their 
chosen means for their wanted image.

Another origin problem, this one on self-interest. Does the “self” first have 
to learn about their “interest” through a sequence of events that is their 
experience, or through trial-and-error unintentionally finds an “interest”? 
Both of these possibilities are identical in at least half of all ways. Whether 
by chance or through the deliberation before acceptance, the “interest” becomes 
a fixation of the “self” to fulfill the “self” by acting in the manner of positive 
relation to the “interest”. In these two possibilities that comprise the whole of 
possibilities for the “self” to discover the “interest”, an interest so great the 
“self” thinks and acts in the direction of it in their belief that it is their 
“self-interest”, it may reason that the supposed randomness of trial-and-error 
and the experience are identical in outputting the same preference as discovery 
to the “self” that then embraces the preference as part of their entire self-interest. 
The phrasing of this origin problem is not merely for the humorous word play of 
differences that rest on a fundamental sameness. The fundamental sameness of 
self-interest in practice cannot be established, and concepts such as “selfishness” 
and “narcissism” are not constant associations with “self-interest”. The first 
possibility of the origin problem supposes the “self” to co-exist in the sequence 
of events. This co-existence is their experience. But in the second possibility, 
the “self” is described as a pro-active agent in the sequence of events, this 
sequence of events at least partly consisting of their choice design for the 
trial-and-error. These characteristic differences then force differing ways of 
explaining self-interest as a universal force, and practices of self-interest 
play out in various ways outside of categorization that can capture the specific 
without categorization that is specific to each specific of the specific. Validation 
of self-interest, as one or more philosophies, tend to draw connections of likeness 
between differing practices believed by the practitioners to be in the name of their 
respective self-interests, and these connections of likeness then converge to singular 
principles on what self-interest is, practices by selves that each one conducts in 
and on their respective systems.

Self-interest, a force that depends on the utility of existing systems, 
perhaps to maintain those existing systems or to improve or to abolish 
them from affecting the “self”, is something circular and most definitely 
self-serving if self-contained, coincidentally self-serving if not. But 
the quality of self-containment is not a consistent variable in outcomes, 
as a reminding note. The centrality of this concept, self-interest, almost 
instantaneously radiates outward in different practice by mass selves. 
There are unclear answers on how self-interest plays a part in socio-economic 
power dynamics, something very fundamental to human beings, frequently 
likened to “social creatures” from the antiquity of thought. To distribute 
the values of power to those in need of those values of power, to retain 
power in order to grow it and build it for the “self” above all. These 
objectives ring familiar bells on the dichotomy of control between the 
state (questionably communist) and the individual (questionably capitalist), 
a dichotomy that remains on one-sided terms if expressed only in verbal 
or written language, flimsy and lofty due to the freedom of interpretation, 
decorative because there is action for construct and then there are words 
for persuasion. These statements, on power dynamics as something the force 
of self-interest has to contend with, rather escalated quickly from the 
realm of something just above the abstract to something not quite exact 
with words, interpretation, and practice in the mass sentient setting. 
With escalations such as these, the role of self-interest as the single 
and active force is not without challenge, for practices stemming from 
fields such as control theory and decision theoretics become the foremost 
point of analysis. And through the backtracking that analyses can produce, 
perhaps self-interest can be narrowed down in the specifics of practice 
amongst its many hosts. This elaboration has at least provided some proof, 
through example, that self-interest is in fact not a self-contained field, 
due to its many outward forms that chooses existing systems to use.

## More on philosophies of self-interest #9

Philosophies of self-interest emphasize to followers principles similar 
to utilitarian ideals. The concept of “self-interest”, when put into 
practice, depends on the usage of existing systems, as already stated. 
And the essential, perhaps the only criteria uniting all that think and 
act in their way for their “self-interest”, is the utility having to be 
geared to the “interest”, done by the “self”. Utilitarian thought is almost 
entirely about the “self” co-existing in the world by acting in a way 
recognized as proper use of systems, in material or immaterial form, by 
those systems’ piecewise or holistic components. Utilitarian thought promotes 
the utility of maximizing output for the “self” given the input, the ideal 
selection/s in the candidates of systems and system components, and this 
is an integrational approach that requires sentient living to make use. 
The sentient being is obliged to be capable of learning about some material 
or skill, then putting a sort of full effort into utilizing that learned 
material or skill, and the physical expression of the sentient being as 
well as their thought generated is frequently connected to the use of 
their preferred material or immaterial system/s, a synergistic fusing, 
per se. Utilitarianism is thus quite externalist, that through what is a 
solution coinciding by construction or existence in the external, there 
is satisfaction. The paradigm also leans towards the transcendental ideals 
of sentient beings, namely human beings, being able to be one with the 
environment, for their cognition to find “happiness” and “comfort” by 
behaviors of domination of their recognized adversities through satisfying 
their recognized problems from and of their “self”. Now, on to “self-interest”. 
With “self-interest”, there is less emphasis on demanding behavior by the 
“self” to exist, in some way or form, in a “comfort zone”. The “self” pursues 
the “interest”, but this does not mean that the “self” and the “interest” 
are not already bound to one another. The “self” can self-understand as 
“self-interest”, identical in cognition. Whereas with utilitarianism, there 
are factors (happiness, et cetera) that the “self” somehow thinks are 
objectives, and thus separated from them in some way, but these objectives 
are what the “self” yearns and strives for by correcting or maintaining the 
expression of behavior in line with their route for these objectives. 
“Self-interest”, in practice, also has objectives, but the objectives do 
not magnetize the host of the “self” for the “self” to act towards them. 
A convincing statement is that “self-interest” is self-driven, propelled 
by the “self” for the “self-interest” thought of by the “self” to be their 
“self”. However, this should not be interpreted as selflessness, for as 
already defined, the “interest” of the “self” is what the “self”, itself, 
is as immortally connected to as what cannot be defined in the scientific 
terms of the material. Objectives of “self-interest” can change, while 
“self-interest” is a constant of sentient existence, with the freedom of varying outward expression. 
“Self-interest” is governed by internalist construct, not innately governed 
by foreign metaphysical or physical forces, and is an element higher in level 
to “motivation” in the hierarchy of cognition. As for utilitarianism, the 
paradigm is a stepping stone towards the pragmatic of developing or obtaining 
solution, typically for the “self”, by conscientious observance and learning 
of the external world. And with the solution achieved, there is a satisfying 
sense in their reaching a finalistic goal, in which case, the sensible courses 
of action and thought for the utilitarian is maintenance of their state by the 
utility, required by them to be controlled by them, of the solution. Since 
“self-interest” has objectives, the satisfaction of these objectives is either 
the solution itself for the “self”, or the approach taken is the solution. 
But “self-interest” remains, and there is not a universal agreement on how 
the self-interested can evolve or form new objective. The de-emphasis of 
external reference to the concept of “self-interest”, in relation to 
utilitarianism, means that the regulatory patterns used by the “self” for 
their “self-interest” do not necessarily have to coincide with external 
material or immaterial.

## More on philosophies of self-interest #10

Manipulative agents such as material, reactions from the material, and 
other means (“agents”, in this usage) that influence cognition become 
paramount variables differentiating the expression of one for utilitarian 
and another for their “self-interest”. The term “interest” in “self-interest” 
serves as an emphasizer on the “interest” in this concept, as something on 
top of “motivation” and tied to the “self”, for the “self” to both exist 
and operate in ways with “interest” so that an “interest” originating from 
outside the self (other selves) is not in the same lane, and there is only 
one lane for the “interest” that the “self” can pursue such that the 
“interest” is immortally connected to the “self”. In utilitarian practice, 
there is a persistent pressure to achieve an equilibrium, and out of 
pragmatism, efforts are concentrated around that stationary point reached, 
the equilibrium. “Self-interest”, on the other hand, encounters more 
incongruencies in the form of friction between the “self” tied to the 
“interest” and the situational decisions the “self” is faced with making. 
The “self”, as self-driven by their “self-interest”, has the liberty to 
modify the directionality of will for these decisions unideal, not of the 
form for a reasonable number of transformations to reach the “ideal” that 
the “self-interest” seeks. But the modification of the will by “self-interest” 
could, in turn, richochet back to the “self” as something understood as a 
pathological action, something incorrect and thus malicious against “self-interest”. 
The “self”, as an agent of their “self-interest”, acts in ways of distinctness 
to challenges that do not necessarily have to be connected to any objective 
of the “self-interest”. Utilitarian compromise of the “self” by the “self” 
taking a particular means to accomplish the objective may also be a possibility 
for the case of the “self” for “self-interest”. But compromise of the “ideal” 
by the “self” is rationalized by the self-interested as something similar to 
forced negotiation. Utilitarian thought only views compromise as forced negotiation 
when the compromise is of a relatively imposing downward force onto the “self”, 
since it is more integrationist, whereas integration could be a result of 
“self-interest” solely through the drive of the “self-interest” for that result, 
the destination. There is less of the two ends, the “self” and the solution, 
meeting half-way in initiatives by the “self” for “self-interest” than by 
utilitarian practice. Thus, utilitarian practice is typically more pre-determined 
than the self-interested in setting limits, not aspirations.

The broad field of choice is of the abstract unquantifiable not because 
of the practice of choice in the spatiotemporal setting. The spatiotemporal 
setting limits the span/s of effecting choice, and the exact degrees of 
spatiotemporal limitation is one crucial factor for the perception of 
determinism, something the self-driven “self” with their “self-interest”, 
in necessary connection to the physical host, has to cooperate with, in 
order to guard the mortality of the host. There are levels to this cooperation. 
It starts with co-existing alongside natural law, laws governing any phenomenon 
that are not subject to the will of the sentient. And then there are activities 
by sentient beings, through their physicalities stemming from natural law. 
Further along, there is the practice of non-physical interaction from sentient 
beings, with purposes such as manipulation of the will belonging to the “self” 
and socialization with the “self”. Manipulation of the will belonging to the 
“self”, to clarify, is externally sourced. Changes of the will’s directionality 
occurs through modification by the “self”’, but this modification if initialized 
by the external is manipulation. The force of “self-interest” is not bound to 
be constant or consistent in outward expression, due to the immediate span of 
choice, free from the spatiotemporal setting, for the “self”. Utilitarian 
initiatives can fall through or take detours into other initiatives. There 
is a difference in the manipulability present. “Self-interest” and utilitarianism 
are partly evident through the expression. But the “interest” to the “self” is 
of a lower level of difference than to the objective/s of the “self”, due to chosen 
utility to the “self”. The “interest” and the “self” are separate only in wording, 
in the context of “self-interest”. But with utilitarianism, there is the “self”, 
their chosen utility given their span/s of choice, and their objective. The degree 
of change in expression for the self-interested has a higher potential of difference 
than that of the utilitarian, one who thinks and acts as a subject of the spatiotemporal 
setting, although not necessarily for objectives that lie in any spatiotemporal setting. 
In manipulation, “self-interest” remains as a force but expresses by something not 
from the original, free from it, due to effects from the external’s changes of the 
will’s directionality. The self-interested that decides on being utilitarian thinks 
and acts in ways not of the original to “self-interest”, if manipulated, and thus 
fails to be utilitarian in the required identity of the original. And the utilitarian 
that is not one purely with their “self-interest” can also be manipulated, such as 
through the alterations and demands presented to them in their spatiotemporal setting, 
although the directionality of the will is still original to the “self-interest”.

## More on philosophies of self-interest #12

Philosophies of self-interest tend to overlap with studies and practices of ethics, 
due to the fact that “self-interest” is necessarily existent and then perhaps evident 
for the practice. And ethics is, as per the wisdom that the human being is a “social 
creature”, a fixture for the “social” creature of subjectivity before objectivity in 
their priorities, the fixture as analysis in the form of cross-examinations and 
introspections relatable to but not required to be related to the natural sciences, 
since sentient beings' understanding of the natural sciences bears relevance outside 
of the manuscripts and natural phenomenon as practiced by sentient beings, practices 
coinciding with natural phenomenon but differing to natural phenomenon by their sole 
association to sentient will, so will has the effecting autonomy to heed natural 
phenomenon for the “self-interest”. This last point of natural phenomenon being 
separate from sentient will is necessary not to promote arguments in duality and 
beyond. Ethics requires separability of cause-and-effect, through means arbitrary 
by reference to natural law that then governs natural phenomenon, for comprehending 
accountable human beings in accountable constructs of human beings; the term 
“accountable” could be interchanged with “responsible” due to interpretations 
from “self-interest”. The aims of ethics for the practice of the subject can be 
phrased as: the demand for satisfactory utility of the entire span of fields, from 
philosophy through the natural sciences to ethics and also past ethics in the 
application of ethics in arbitrarily structured format, this being the “law for 
human beings”.

## More on philosophies of self-interest #13

Through the lens of ethics, the thinking and actions of sentient beings can 
be what is called “judged” in the form of adjectives that carry more than 
quantitative meaning, although anything with quantitative meaning can be 
directly associated with adjectives not under the domain of quantity, so 
elaboration on this point is needed. Some examples of the thinking and actions 
of sentient beings can then be argued, in ways convincing to untamed sentiments 
of “self-interest”, moving the directionality of will for “self-interest”, to 
be adjectives such as “foolish”, “criminal”, “unruly”, and “dishonest” with 
great followings for intended results such as great grievances, great inflation 
of ego, et cetera. In a related field, there is drama, and the structurization 
of sentient activity, namely the activity of human beings, into that which elicits 
sentiment is dramatization. Without subjectivity, there can be no ethics. With 
subjectivity in the form of intense sentiment expressed in outward form by the 
will, sometimes in opposition to the directionality of origin belonging to the 
“self-interest”, ethics serves as the field that regulates through the encouragement 
of introspection alongside outward observation of case studies, in juxtaposition to 
the form the literary fields take, record and narration for the product being a 
drama from dramatization. And this is not meant to lead to assumption that ethics 
does not require recording and narration, only that the centrality of ethics is 
in regulating human behavior, by the basic internal-external duality mentioned, 
without the necessity of prescribed consequences as manifested by practices of 
“law for human beings” that use ethics as a cornerstone. The practice of ethics 
can use drama, but this particular intersection should not be confusing on the 
purpose, even though the effects of ethics and drama can converge to be one and 
the same. Orthodoxically, drama elicits, draws in cognition to produce output from 
cognition, and ethics is intended to encapsulate the comprehension of behaviors, 
represented as narrative cover or indisputable truths of phenomenon, for principles 
of thinking and behavior to be set into place, thus influencing the effects of the 
will’s directionality onto the “self” because of their “self-interest”. “Self-interest”, 
in its more outward appearances of sentient thinking and behavior, is undeniably tied 
to ethics, the connection a cause of varying doubt and conviction through the question 
for the cause of the “self-interest”.

## More on philosophies of self-interest #14 

The previous note made the claim: "without subjectivity, there can be no
ethics". Furthering the argument in favor of this claim, a very 
well-known concept called the "sphere of influence" is used. So without 
subjectivity, there is no need for ethics because ethics is what is 
conducted by sentient will to be analyzed by sentient will, namely that 
of human beings since ethics is anthrocentric, for dualistic judgment of 
the effects from sentient will. Judgments are necessary because effects 
by sentient will are of an inferiority to the low-level correctness of the 
authentic axiom. Effects by sentient will only demand proper utility of 
whatever authentic axiom. All axioms are authentic in the scope of truth's 
judgment. However, the adjective "authentic" was derived from "axiom" and 
placed before "axiom" to emphasize the nature of the axiom, not of an 
artificial unit or any other unit that can be utilized by the will, not 
ruling the wanted effects of sentient will. The construct of a sphere of 
influence is curious with regards to the intention of axiom. One concept is 
quite clearly the prime unit of human rationale on why spheres of influences 
are formed: "self-interest". It is self-interest before collective interest, 
although the critical variable of success may be collective interest. But the 
measurable quantity of any effecting collective interest would be given a 
distortion in appearance if it was likened to a single variable in the manner 
of use for conventional algebraic expressions in mathematics. The collective, 
meaning the mass of human beings, after reaching consensus on the predominant 
initiatives, although the specific form and the specific movement of each of 
the collective do not have to coincide and only required to overlap in 
judgment of similarity, consists of individuals with self-interests that 
overlap. This phenomenon, in every case of a united collective, goes back by 
reason to how the "self" understands the "self" along with "interest" for 
their "self-interest", understanding that takes into account co-existing 
selves and self-interests. It is also through the sphere of influence that 
absurdities are believed, by those of or against the construct. Absurdities 
are the most farfetched out of the class of believable fallacies, although 
this may be reasonably put into question out of wordplay and misunderstanding 
of the word "absurdity". Another case of the technical difficulties in using 
natural language as the primary tool of explanation. "Absurd" could be "ridiculous", 
but "ridiculous" could be true, while "absurd" is less in believability than a 
"half-truth", a concept with a quantitative mark attached to describing a 
statement in truth. The question of believing a statement or body of statements 
is a decision by "self-interest" to accept only if the "self" is aligned with 
its own will in a way that can be visualized as a direct alignment between 
"self-interest", undetachable from the "self" in any conceptualization, and the 
will of the "self". The freedom to visualize is the freedom to fabricate on 
matters such as the intangible, immeasurable by most natural (biological) senses, 
and especially the immeasurable. To elaborate on a possible route of crafting 
believability of an absurdity, think of a random human being as being labeled 
an adjective, and this labeling is upheld by the sphere in the same aura as the 
believability of an axiom. From there, the sphere of influence operates in the 
manner of a mechanical system that either does not have to perform frequent 
introspection or one that does not have introspective capabilities. The human 
being is claimed to have done some particular things. Because the sphere of 
influence labeled that particular human being a specific adjective, members 
of the sphere of influence, in turn, believe the human being to have done those 
particular things, without anything close to being as real as the direct experience 
that can be recalled by cognitive instruments of healthy structure, such as 
functioning human brains (roughly speaking).

Subjectivity is a matter for cognition, with two primary bodies of 
understanding and believing it. This is a duality that adds to the 
complexity of the duality between the subjective and the objective. The 
first body is the objective that can be represented as the subjective, for 
a version of the objective that has the validity of being subject to challenge 
from sentient will or compared with alternatives on scales selected by 
"self-interest". For something to be objective does not necessitate that something 
to be about the axiom, or for the axiom. The objective, by "self-interest", is a 
design constructed by the axiom for a wanted truth to be actualized, typically 
through perceivable action by a sentient being, and the wanted truth is not of 
the same fundamental as the axiom but something left to chance, probability with 
no absolute for one outcome, with probability that is intended to be manipulated 
for the wanted outcome/s by focus of effort on the input of said wanted outcome/s. 
Design of anything can be interpreted in the subjective by the use of "self-interest" 
operating on a will of a contrarian comparison to the design. Similarly, the term 
"style" can be used synonymously with "design". A convention for usage, however, 
is "design" is for the inanimate material structured by sentience, and "style" 
is the movement outwardly communicated by "self-interest". In both of these, 
"self-interest" determines the preference that requires satisfying of axiom/s, 
although "self-interest" does not need to acknowledge the existence or most accurate 
(by relativity) expression of the axiom. The axiom exists without usage. The axiom 
is what existence orbits around. The axiom is one among many in essence, the 
irreducible and unmanipulable core that is responsible for producing sentient 
will. Any "use" of the axiom in fact subjects one to being an agent of the axiom, 
and so any construct made by sentience first has to subject one or more sentient 
beings to represent the axiom/s. A belief is then given credit to those that uphold 
the construct, affirming the illusion that with the construct, an arbitrary number 
of axiom/s can be controlled by supercession of the construct's expression over 
arbitrary use. Truthfully, the axiom/s cannot be controlled, rather the expression 
in ways possibly more than by written or verbal communication can be controlled. 
The action because of "self-interest" is also prone to the illusion of control 
over the axiom. It is for this reason that sentient "objective" is quite often 
due entirely to the subjective, the preference by "self-interest" out of the 
will's directionality. The "objective" is not entirely predictable, outside of 
demand to sustain the physical host of "self-interest" (nutrition). Subjectivity, 
through challenge posed by "self-interest" from the will, can also be used to 
represent the axiom in non-interfering ways with the axiom. The constant existence 
of the axiom does not require recognition, in accurate forms for action from 
the axiom, from "self-interest".

The sphere of influence, being a construct that "self-interest" navigates 
and operates in, practically connected to the spatiotemporal context, has 
to be thought of as a practice by the decision of "self-interest", given 
their actionable span/s of choice. This view does assume that those capable 
of "self-interest" are not deterministic, something debatable. The ancient 
Thracian Democritus, from a long time ago, offered wisdom on the understanding 
of the world in the form of the Democritean atom, a precursor notion with 
virtually no practical application until nuclear science became formalized 
for engineering purposes in the 20th century. But for fair credit in attribution, 
it was those of the thinking along Democritus that helped continue the rationalization 
of individuality right down to the "self-interest", capable of generating the thought 
and action completely distinct from immediately neighboring self-interests of other 
selves. There cannot be much misconception from the "self" about the "self-interest" 
that affects the "self", only the host of the "self", since them two are inextricably 
connected such that the written form for the "self" is a synonym of the written form 
for the "self-interest". The objective is where "self-interest" may be undeserving 
of or misled towards. And the lack of objective exclusive to the "self" is what is 
sometimes required by the judgment of the collective, in turn expressing the self-guiding 
axiom of the "self-interest" by affecting the will, in ways such as alteration of the 
will's directionality. Here is where perception of a particular "self", this written 
use of "self" meant to consider the "self" as something observable from a third-party 
perspective, may also be influenced by the judgment of that same "self" in the paradigm 
of a particular sphere of influence. Judgments of the qualities belonging to a sphere 
of influence are by use of probabilistic means, and can be misconceived as 
absolutist or dualist due only to the specific categorical labels considered 
in judgment. "Transcendence" is a label for "spiritualistic" or "emotive" 
phenomenon that breaks out of containment, the sphere of influence or something 
directly connected to the sphere of influence, for timespans not so temporary. 
The "transcendence" is typically metaphysical when related to "self-interest" 
as a phenomenon experienced by the host of "self-interest". The containment is 
usually a mixture of the physical and the metaphysical (immeasurable cognition 
and other bodily functions belonging to the host of "self-interest") connected 
to "self-interest". It is the notion of "transcendence", something similar to 
triumph in the visual depiction of floating or soaring upwards, that is a 
cornerstone of representing the power of "self-interest" to be victorious in 
adversarial conditions. Glorifying portrayals of events, historical or entirely 
fictional, by themes such as corruption, liberation, and rebellion heavily rests 
on the abstract of floating or soaring upwards in ways obviously physical for 
the intended effects of eliciting belief that the spiritual sense likewise moves 
in the same orientation, this being the "transcendence" from the construct, 
the sphere of influence, unwanted by the "self-interest" for the "self" to 
exist in or co-exist with. The first layer of activity for the "self-interest" 
is seldom the last layer in matters of the physical, and activity in the 
"sphere of influence" is the last layer that "self-interest" is a driver for.

For one to "find a reason" to think some way or do some thing is odd in the 
phrasing. Of importance more than null is the context, that which is 
comprised of the immediate spatiotemporal setting perceivable to the senses 
of the "self-interest", and the cognition from internalist mechanisms 
responsible for such things as feelings, theories, memories, and forecasts, 
such that the permutatorial proceedings of the "self-interest", the will, 
and the motivation, in ascending order of predominant influence with respect 
to one another, yields the reason as a body attached in some manner to the will 
and the motivation. The reason, after attachment in this way stated, is a 
cause for cognition or action. Finding a reason to do something could be translated 
to a matching of the context with the cause for cognition or action. But 
this translation lacks in describing the form and execution, typically in 
linear or linearizable information structures, as well as the aims of the 
activity that follows reason, equivalently the cause that has to be found 
for the aims. In the context lies the aims that, if not spatially based, must 
be forged through a metaphysical interaction. After the cause is established for 
the aims, the methodological course is produced in degrees of abstractness and 
specificities, from the "self-interest" that uses information for constructing 
this course into cognition. Meaning is important in the usage after the recollection 
of information, and meaning is attached in the form of input into motivation 
that then works with will for the recollection, out of "self-interest". Meaning is 
something out of perception, and for sentience to perceive must surely be done only 
through the will, and information from the perception is passed back through the 
"self-interest" to the units of cognition for meaning as input into motivation. The 
methodological course cannot be constructed without meaning, such construction 
done in ways of the parallels, perpendiculars, complements, variants alongside, 
and derivatives from in ways of believed compatibilities with the aims from the 
cause, the reason that was found. So, to "find a reason" is the cause to formulate 
and use a methodological course of thinking and action. The phrasing can lead 
to misconception, since to "find a feeling" is a subset of "find a reason", but 
not the converse.

The Democritean atom can be interpreted as a template with some rather 
disconcerting implications. The "self" can never be one that cannot be 
resisted, pushed, or forced in other directions strange by linear comparison. 
The "self" exists in a greater whole. From a humanist sense, the "self" is 
directly associated to a host that is a human being. Consider the "self" as 
being part of the metaphysical control system responsible for the host. To 
give full credit to the existence of equality and impact to other human beings, 
the "self" must therefore be represented as one among many other selves. 
The Democritean atom in antiquity developed to this modern day's understanding 
of the atom, one of the smallest building blocks of spatiotemporal reality, 
is associated with the phenomenon of atomic chain reactions. In short, one 
atom is connected to another atom to another in a particular arrangement, with 
little chance of there being a void in atoms where an entire subspace is 
also not void, and the split of one atom into something other radiates impact 
onto connected atoms that follow suit to their affector atom that split. The 
atomic chain reaction may be believed as natural because of contemporary 
understanding of modern reality. But to apply the Democritean atom to the 
"self" alongside other selves, metaphorically other Democritean atoms, may 
not suit certain ideologies, especially out of the freedom for chains of 
events occurring in the analogy of atomic chain reactions. There is a deterioration 
of control in these chains of events. Of noteworthy characteristic, due 
to broadness, of these chains of events is that no individual could possibly 
be responsible for maneuvering and directing the atomic chain reaction, only 
that the atomic chain reaction could start by any one individual. Perception 
changes of the "self", of any self, for this matter that is anticipated more 
often than not according to the qualities of the specific social setting, 
qualities that cannot all be directly perceived but can be derived from collation 
processed involved in perception, with varying degrees of accuracy that can 
only be proved until after the facts directly part of the prediction. Entertaining 
the analogy of atomic chain reactions in human social settings most definitely has 
gone on far before the formal discovery, through objective means by metrics of 
empirical measurement, of the atomic chain reaction phenomenon. That is the only 
plausible rationale for the longevity of some civilizations, these civilizations' 
adoption and retention of practices and constructs maladaptive or high-performing, 
despite the axiomatic nature of the atom that has been and continues to be used 
as to support one ideal modality of living, known as individualism. And so, the 
matter of narrating events on human beings, in the context of hierarchy, frequently 
produce notions on the individual as one that transcended the restrictions of their 
existence as an impactless atom, or an atom either unconnected to other atoms or 
one that is unsplittable, for then there cannot be any chain reaction started from it.

The practice of self-interest always had and has a curious relationship with 
social theory. Treat the human in the way of a lone atom, call them an 
individual but do them as if they were a disconnected part from the whole, 
for what they are perceived to be after, before, or on top of the social 
theory applied onto them. Social theory is convenient for self-interest to not 
acknowledge if some conditions are satisfied. The basic physical demands, food 
and water, for the host of self-interest are met in full. Then there is the 
question of socio-economic perception of the host, according to the metrical 
comparison of expected and actual. Social theory, put into practice by a 
piecewise selection of all social theory ever conceptualized onto paper or not, is 
what is essentially the social construct. The concept that is a "social construct", 
in turn, leads to misconception of its comprehension, and obviously, through its use 
produces misconceptions. The social construct is not material. The social construct is 
perception, judgment, and behavior as practiced by the many selves in this world, 
participated in after any conception of the "self" and through movement, produces 
change for changes that are more constant than not for the constancy. And this is 
evident by the material restructurized and methodologies of the mind and body. No 
social construct can ever be wholesome, by the premise of its effects. A social 
construct produces effects in the form of spheres of influence.  Any sphere of influence 
rests inside another sphere of influence that could be the identical to the former, 
depending on the qualities of containment revolving around and intrinsic to it. And 
any sphere of influence has a fluid quality to it. Perception of a social construct 
can be objective in the detail of fact, but when preference is required, there is 
always judgment. In the social setting, the lack of axiom is for no matter that can 
be entirely of the axiom, and that is why protests against any social construct always have 
a ridiculous nature to them. To protest something is to decry or denounce by a negativity 
similar to ridiculing something, as an equating rule in judgments regarding the disapproval 
of the social construct. Ridicule is to trade perceived absurdity for another statement, 
most likely the conceptualization of the perceived absurdity which is then absurdity by 
reduction to the essence, but perhaps the conceptualization is not interpreted as absurd 
due to its accuracy of the absurdity. Nevertheless, the centrality is absurdity. 
Disapprovals of social constructs are propelled by the lack of understanding, but 
to understand something for what it is must be a process of reduction to the axioms 
known. The issue with this reduction to the axiom is that in practically all social 
matters, the reduction results in such things as gravity, oxygen, and universally 
acknowledged economic demands of body and mind, therefore falsely representing all 
social matters as essentially equal. Attaching the variable of quantity, a practice 
of an axiom, onto these matters adds more clarity. And then there are descriptors such 
as adjectives and more lengthy forms of accounting that may have their usage rest 
completely on arbitrariness. But for the sake of comprehension, every accounting 
tool of adjective or lengthier forms have references in counterpart or identity 
of medians and extremums, but with no guarantee of its correct usage by the will 
of the "self". And thus, social theory does not depend entirely on natural 
law of axioms because it is attempted understanding, depiction, and replication 
of preferences in sentient decisions and other qualities for selected 
spatiotemporal contexts. Social theory advances statements that rest on the 
preference of subjectivity. In order for the social theory to yield effects 
greater than cognitive processing of its forms of marketing such as through 
educative means, meaning the social theory necessarily has to become a fixture 
for a social construct or even become an entire social construct, certain 
statements of the social theory have to be treated as axioms, something more 
than an assumption for the convenience of no effort of proof by interaction 
or observation. But statements of social theory seldom rest on natural law, 
so cannot be axioms, certainly processed through cognition can they be 
recognized as axioms though. The intent of any social theory is to produce 
artificial axioms that may as well be axioms, always through the will can 
there be belief in the artificial axiom and designs in accordance with the 
calculated means for its success and duration in the social setting that 
is supposed to be a social construct for the social theory.

The word, as used to label the metaphysical, serves as an identifier for 
that what is labeled. There are limits in pragmatics, outside of the use 
of the word for cognitive processing, not to underestimate the effect of 
cognitive processing on the same internalist mechanisms that produces it, 
let alone the effects of cognitive processing as triggers for measurable 
biological function that may slip out of the control of the self's will, 
and for decisions as outward actions. The word then cannot be anymore than 
a medium, a symbol for interpretation. For an entire society to be able 
to think and do nothing without words is a society doomed to fail. There 
is only the translation and transcription. Where is the primal cause that 
is exactly one unit of smallest difference to the axiom? A society that 
is heavily reliant on the word cannot be advanced unless there is something 
under. The previous statement is so obvious that it means nothing for 
the pragmatics of additional development on top of the present infrastructure 
that is the utility of knowledge for the methodologies and material constructs. 
The statement could very well be spun by interpretation for words of 
analogous assortment, for meanings outside of the bluntness, perhaps 
something sharp or witty to please the humors, cracking smiles on all of 
those faces, or something that is a patronizing remark on the follies of 
introspection that could have taken many years only to miss the mark by 
many immeasurable distances. Additionally, the statement could be interpreted 
as a call to deconstruct understanding right down to the axiom, which then 
would not demand any words to be used, leaving sentient existence little 
else to do but the predominantly physical. Herein lies more issues with the 
usage of the word. The word, as used for ultimate consideration, must 
consider all span/s of possibilities, synonymously any thing that lies in 
any pair of extrema for the topic/s. Then when the time for action through 
preference is demanded, this being how the will of the sentient shows itself, 
the entire span/s cannot possibly be acted on in full. The word is used to 
produce replication of understanding and awareness of said understanding, 
but as for the "self", the "self" has always been the one responsible 
for making use of the word. The "self" does not understand the word without 
the experience, and the experience cannot happen without the capability 
of the host belonging to the "self". Capability can be engineered outside 
of the control of the "self" for the "self". It is themes from this that 
helped to produced some of the most heartfelt literature and social 
dynamics, from an emotive perspective. To take the word as a uni-directed 
meaning that rests on assumptions through interpretation, void of 
consideration for the directionality of the will that resulted in 
the use, and the intended effects of that usage, is something personal 
to the "self". And the "self" that feels obliged to reciprocate does 
so in ways also perceived to be heartfelt, from an emotive perspective. 
This is subjectivity that cannot be rationally disputed through 
attempts to be objective on the immeasurable. The cause for the 
appearance and the behavior from metaphysical matters, such as 
interpretation of the word, is something that has to be taken in 
full after whatever skepticism and inquiries were conducted on the 
perception, in order for credibility of belief to persist. There is 
a gap in explanation by the word. Essentially, any interaction between 
selves produces something like an axiom, specifically an artificial 
axiom, that serves as a generality for the image of understanding 
greater than the axiom, the constant. The "self" is understood, 
through use of the word, by others outside the realm of immediate 
perception. Presumptions are constructed, expectations are demanded 
for order. Aristotelian logic used to systematize the metaphysical, 
a great part of this being the potential, of a sentient being is 
typically not subjective by intrinsic analyses. The composition of 
works in Aristotelian logic rely on the axiom, so to dissect the 
relational arrangements of these words, without the external 
reference, would directly result in a downward fashion to the 
axiom, the constant. There would be nothing else to question, 
only to take the work as a wholesome artificial axiom because it is 
essentially axiom. Similarly, Aristotelian logic places the word, 
outside of smallest difference to the axiom, in the way of an orientation 
alongside the counterpart words to the word. And these words cannot 
be immediately discredited in and of themselves, because every word 
is a unit for natural language, the consensus for the mapping of 
sound or concatenated writing strokes to meaning, although 
every word could be described in additional words. For these words, 
references to them, these references found predominantly in the 
measurable spatiotemporal contexts, are what is required to prove 
that the word fits, through the discrimination of application. 
There is an innate imprecision from the preference of word use 
the "self" has to contend with, and also decisions of quantifying 
what occurs from the declared artificial axiom, necessarily 
constructed beforehand, in the degrees of distance, metaphysical 
in some instances, for the "self" to develop their own truths, 
of artificial axiom, on top of the constants that do not always 
require the consideration of the "self", through expression 
by the "self" on the constants' existences and plausibilities. There 
is no centrality of the word that is not another word in a self-contained 
reasoning, what the source of the expressing of Aristotelian logic 
originally is without application, and this places responsibility 
onto the "self" for confirmation and belief through their own 
application.

A major misconception is that individualism is a Western thing, 
collectivism an Eastern thing. That is how some concepts are 
explained in the basic sense. In practically every nation, there 
are icons that are human, not necessarily elevated to anything equal to a 
demi-god or beyond. Every icon is an individual, so every nation 
practices individualism to a certain extent. The strict dichotomy 
is probably necessary to an extent, on top of the existing translation 
issues, due to there existing additional considerations besides from the 
elevation of the individual to the status of icon, as requirements 
for individualism to be present. Then the discussion entirely 
turns into many topics, with social theory sitting somewhere on top. 
Human societies of various ideologies "make their people", as confusing 
as the quotation sounds. A human being is born, but then has to 
be made by their people? The quotation effects changes onto 
self-interest. The quotation, when enmeshed into social 
decision-making, from human being to human being, that is, 
originally drives self-interest in degrees of changing directionalities 
and magnitudes. The will remains the same though, as clarification, 
despite what involvement of the practice of "make their people". 
Individualism is not always what self-interest is geared to, 
but it happens for some reasons more often in certain regions 
only due to the acceptance of the challenge the individual poses, 
in other regions a continuation of informatic projection (that 
is what legacy is a part of). For reasons stemming from the 
dichotomy that must be implicit by generational design, with 
the freedom by self-interest to explicitly structure and describe 
for promoting others' understandings through those courses, 
social and cultural studies are infinite in discussion by the 
variance of the pertaining information on different peoples 
having distinction yet equality, through the explicit mention, 
while the localities of the practices are also unique. To elaborate, 
it is as if one were to ask 1000 absolutely illiterate but compliant 
people how they would write the number 7. There would be at least 
one way, and goes all the way up to 1000. And that is only the 
initial decision that each illiterate person makes. There are 
many variables besides from writing the number 7 that serve as 
topics of such great variance. Regarding the question of compatibilities, 
no two human beings could possibly turn adversarial against each 
other if both were tasked with finding out as much about one another 
based on their roots, their heritage, their present and prior experience 
on the penalty of unwanted death for their failure through deliberate 
inadequacy or incompetence. Peace would need to be maintained, until the 
job is done for one or both. Another peculiar aspect on social and cultural 
studies is observing how the individual adapts to a changing world, the 
changes very incongruent and not so cleanly cut based on geographic 
area. Also in this aspect, so many articles could be written on 
this as a lone topic that entire libraries would be filled up with 
nothing but similarities and differences, in the context of localities 
and globalities, through the accounting of the individual and the 
individual's collective. There always seems to be expectations for 
the individual, despite what collectivist policy and arrangements 
have or were put into place to involve them. Just as types such 
as misers and vengeance seekers gain a lot of gratification through 
the suffering of select others, the breaking of the collective 
or individual expectation has a proportional degree of emotive 
energy elicited, frequently hysterical and demented when the 
top and only paradigm is determinism. For these matters, there 
seldom are answers adequate enough to fulfill perceived inadequacies 
of empirical accounting, scientific, mathematical, narrative, et 
cetera, and perhaps even the explanation from religious/political 
authorities also falls short of quelling the perceived hurt from 
expectations unmet. Whatever the explanations, the explanations either 
depend on the use of or rest on the existence of the will. For some 
things failed or unmet, that would be the doing of the will, much 
to the chagrin of certain self-interests. When there are mysteries 
in human decision-making or the material constructs that humans produce 
to eventually crumble, the remaining mystery irreducible to any more 
detail or infinitesimal material is caused by the will. That is 
where the will comes into underlying play. The ideal can be dichotomized 
into individual and the collective. The individual that lives in the 
same image before their experience of the ideal must be deluded. 
Expectations can never be met according to the self-interest of 
sternness in comparing the actual with the ideal. The actual is more 
experience of default arbitrariness than what the ideal is portrayed 
as, and so, must require the correct directionalities of the will 
for the self-interest in order to be satisfactory to self-interest, 
outside of the reference to their conceptualization of the ideal. 
In another possibility for understanding what the individual and 
the collective really mean, there are the cases of individuals, 
despite in what society they lived in, to become resolved to their 
"own path", withdrawing themselves to a reliance on remembering 
the actuality they have come to believe through their experience 
of the actual, before paying their attention to any image of ideal. 
From a rubric that considers these individuals' cognitive states, 
the individuals would be individualist. But the collective can 
represent these individuals as collectivists, in order to maintain 
the notion that said individuals have been fully integrated in 
the scope of behavior and attitudes. So there are things not mentioned 
about the individual, in individualistic or collectivistic settings. 
In certain realities that have produced literary works that reflect 
back on those realities, some noteworthy dynamics serve as astute 
examples of the troubles underneath clean-cut dichotomies. There 
is the guard as the tormentor, or the guard as the traitor, when 
the guard is an individual designated to act for a collectivistic 
interest. But seemingly out of nowhere, the guard, out of his own 
greed and desires foreign to those he is supposed to guard, proceeds 
on a different economical route of compromise to what is ordered to him 
to be the fixture, as per the duties declared onto him the guard. 
The male pronoun is used for the reason of the male being the 
predominant gender in physical security arrangements. But in a 
parallel way, human females can do no better. And in the nationalist 
context, there is the jealous neighbor, the terrible town bullies, 
and then the foreigners as the secret admirers and worshippers of 
that specific individual, supposed to always be regarded as an 
icon, as long as the practice of history goes on. Dynamics such as 
these show the unexpected that believed loyalties can result in 
with just the right kind of flux. Self-interest means nothing in 
some places, supposedly in hyper-collectivist or anti-individualist 
arrangements; it is the will that is responsible. And this nullification 
cannot be summarized with just these two labels, "hyper-collectivist" 
and "anti-individualist", without there being dishonesty. Something 
the individual with their self-interest, dependent on their will, 
contemplates either rationally or emotively, at least every so often.

Human beings can be the most insulting there are. There is no way 
around this statement if considered in the holistic sense. For 
statements that become reasons such as the one two sentences 
back, the "self" develops certain behaviors in thinking and action 
based on the experience. The host of the "self", upon belief that their 
siblings have been informing on them to the police to keep them broke 
and terrorized, has other notions of blood. The host of the "self", 
upon believing that they have been treated like a lab rat for lethal 
poisons and viruses, places less faith in doctors. The host of the 
"self", after believing that their internet activity has been sold 
by their own government to foreign political organizations, becomes 
a Luddite. The host of the "self", upon being discovered by their elders 
of their seeking independence, gets their belongings confiscated 
and labeled a handicapped and crippled piece of trash by their welfare 
system. The "self" remains with the host after the host is let down 
and set back by the collective. Perhaps that is the most important 
merit for the preference of individualism over collectivism. What 
the human being, as a "social creature", does is meddle and inform, 
at best, if their skills and expertise are not called for. It is 
the experience from human being to human being that produces pathological 
hate for the human, that is what misanthropy is. All cravings of blood 
not for the meal are part of this long-lasting emotive body. The collective 
is not a mechanical system from the start. It is not even entirely organic. 
Through the propensities of the appearance of the human being, leanings 
become careers and institutions. Women easy on the eyes aim to become 
whores for the sons of aristocrats. Men of unusual size and strength 
become icons in big sports. These are merely two examples and they 
focus entirely on the physical appearance, but through them, the reader 
can very well gather, by recollection of their own experience, how 
the humanities portray things and what really goes on in socio-economic 
policy, with appearances, talents, and governance. Human beings can 
also be the most helpless, without institutions backing their wars 
and deceptions. Individuals become slaves before knowing it, from the 
perspective of psychological acknowledgment. Ultimately, to become upset 
over another human being's loss is something else outside of the procedures 
and status, despite what reason for their loss. To adhere to a social 
system that was designed by human beings, but to somehow have issues 
with the system at specific points in time?

Sentient intelligence is a social value in practice. It cannot 
be anything more without relation to other intelligences. There would 
only be actions and products initiated by sentient intelligence, but 
the actions and products would merely have occurred or exist as a 
change onto the physical world. One way to counter the previous 
statement is promoting the notion of the "self" actually being 
"self-referential" and "self-justifying" without immunity, but only 
through the lack of social settings capable of producing challenge in 
physical or psychological form can this notion be accepted without the 
longest and most thoughtful intellectual conversations in the whole entire 
galaxy. Intelligence is a value that, with training and application, becomes 
refined in the way of metalworking products, but intelligence is not entirely 
metal. Intelligence becomes the worst thing for sociability when the sentient 
being has to dedicate virtually all of their efforts to develop the works 
of their intelligence for propagation, whereas competitors in socio-economically 
comfortable positions can simply censor them according to the respective 
construct of prescribed power. These situations must be in the manner of mind 
slavery for others, in the economic dogma of capitalism where both time and 
emotions can somehow be quantified into money for the money. The products of 
intelligence can be replicated, a statement that goes against the whole "knowledge 
is power" axiom (very questionably), since as already stated, sentient intelligence 
is a social value and requires relations to the external world to exist in 
practice of effects with other sentience, and thoughts can be transcribed onto 
paper and/or machine with a relative degree of inaccuracy, however the idea and 
the formulae still become present in material form. The knowledge economy is 
governed by knowledge authorities. That is the structure that self-interest 
must navigate in order to extract gold, metaphysical or not, from the knowledge 
economy, hopefully netting something before becoming too demoralized to 
continue the high road of thought, instead having to resort to the practice, 
borne from "schools" of pragmatics, as if that resort ever blindly turned 
an eye to subjective mistakes in the same leniency as the intellectual 
sphere. There is a relation between knowledge and power, sure. The relation 
is that knowledge can be both a precursor for obtaining victory for power, 
and knowledge can also be produced from the power of accurate cognitive 
direction in problem-solving. This, as a reminder, does not mean that 
knowledge is power, only somewhere in the equation. The understanding 
of power typically adopts the forms of broad concepts first, then 
becomes implemented into the specificities of decorum belonging to 
human beings under that power. As an example of why knowledge and power 
are not one and the same, memorize this scenario. A human being, out 
of their self-interest, believes in sharing and promoting certain 
knowledges, as a testament to their goodwill, only to get shot in 
the face. Moral relativism exists in this scenario if and only if 
the "self" were to remain impartial, thereby granting them the cognitive 
freedom, out of their will not steadfast in directionality, to think 
whatever of the event at any point in time or space during their 
host's remaining existence. Here is another example. The authorities 
demand a human being use their brain to produce some work, as part of 
social responsibility to the public. The human being refuses, escapes, 
and joins a revolt. What kind of intelligence is needed then of them that 
does not also require "chance"? And what kind of changes would that 
intelligence produce? The human being only wanted to be left alone. 
Curiosity closed on the question of demands prescribed by the socially 
responsible onto sentient intelligence, sentient intelligence is a social 
value. Intellectual purity is a myth. At best, there is creativity original 
by the lack of immediate reference, first buried before being cherished by 
those that no longer have the inconvenience of having to think those thoughts 
into material form for society, the collective, or whatever. There is 
already one copy. Then there are institutions for regulatory bureaucracy 
and big business. What is really the "self" in civilization, with 
the potential to not have to hunt or farm for a living?

The philosophy and the living justify and reinforce each other through 
symbiotic ties for introspection, application, validation, and evolution. 
Just as numbers cannot be invented, but the mathematical sciences contain 
inventions used to rationalize meanings about numbers, the practice of 
philosophy has never produced "pure reason", that is reason without 
exemplifying statement, reason that is pure truth as an operation and operator, 
a systematic rationalizer greater in quality than the boolean. Philosophy, 
past the rudimentary of the axiom that is unable to be produced and only 
discoverable or re-discoverable and the empiricism of the natural world, 
becomes split by perspectives. Each perspective of noteworthy interest is 
required to argue for non-axiomatic statements of a questionable truthfulness. 
Certain schools of philosophies promote the idea of some universal thing that is 
more elaborate than the axiom, yet just as grounded in principle and 
intrinsic provability as the axiom. But these promotions do, in fact, 
require believers since quite frequently, only through approved behaviorial 
approaches can some of these universal ideals be accomplished according 
to what is deemed right. And some behaviors are intentionally rehearsed 
by the "self" for what the "self" believes is for the right ideal or whatever. 
The "self" has the freedom to focus entirely on the "way of living" in order 
to practice the wanted philosophy. Such emphasis on the practice, the "way of 
living", over acquiring full memory and awareness of the essence of the philosophy 
through more formal ways, is quite common for areas in which the written word 
does not have a strong mark in pushing the student of that particular philosophy.
The written word is more of an introductory reference, a note that remains in 
case of the school's upheaval. The written word simply does not have the adequacy 
of expressing formulated effective methodologies for all cases of the generic 
problem/s the philosophy is designed to solve for. Preference for the independence 
of "practicing" over "studying" the philosophy carries an implication. The "self" 
is not so much intent on the "love of wisdom" as they are on reaping as much 
benefit from their own personal use of the specific philosophy they practice. 
Self-interest takes precedence as the source of objective for the "self" in 
either the preference of the "practice" or the "study". But the "practice" 
clearly focuses more on gains for the "self" as a living agent, forced to take 
up practices of one or more way/s of life to achieve some wanted existential 
state. The "study", on the other hand, is for the understanding of 
the "follower", serving as a metric for how well the follower has integrated 
themself amongst their peers in the same school of philosophy. The practitioner 
focuses more on their own progress, and all else being equal to the student, 
sees the improvements in their way of living as indicative of the power of 
their chosen philosophy. The student, with their strict observance of the 
philosophy's axioms, does not place as much value on the application, for in 
their puritanical perspective, any practice perfected relies on the trueness 
of the axioms relied upon. All perfected practices are perfect by their performances' 
reference, but not all systematic bodies of thought carry the same quality. 
The student and the practitioner seldom are completely distinct in their 
approach to the same philosophy. But the potentials of the 
student and that of the practictioner eventually diverge to produce two 
different kinds of characters. The student becomes a teacher of their craft, and 
the practitioner a master of their living. By some unclear dynamics through the 
means utilized, the practitioner that has achieved mastery may, in turn, be a 
poor teacher of the very philosophy they mastered. The emphasis they place 
on mastering the ways outside of the philosophy's official forms grants them 
the advantage of greater performance through unorthodox knowledge acquired through 
the personal experience. But the greater performance is strongly associated with 
the practitioner's identity, and not entirely with the philosophical prescriptions 
they were supposed to adhere to as devoted students of the school. In the extreme 
cases, the practitioner aims for their self-empowerment, for power in excess by 
relativistic comparison, and the student after becoming a teacher becomes 
more dogmatic, loyal to the foundational principles that they were educated 
under.

The self understands the world by their own references of knowledge and 
belief. Through the will, self-interest makes the determination, seemingly 
arbitrary from the perspective of others, of the centralities of perception, 
and the will of the self stands by those recognized centralities. The 
centralities consist of those topics the self recognizes as most essential 
to their understanding of the world. Without one centrality, it is as if an 
entire column of reality somehow lacks the support to continue making sense 
to the self. Confidence is eroded, and the self is left to wonder how their 
personally recognized centrality could possibly be replaced with something 
else similar to an immoveable axiom, the only way to restore sense and order 
to something that has become so outlandish without the support of their 
recognized centrality. Without the centrality, the reference to a source 
could be perceived as the source, and both the reference and source could 
be misidentified as extraneous variables. Understanding would not take the 
form proper to that which involves the self's chosen centrality. There become 
more ways to understand, due to more pathways unleashed by the lack of structure 
the centrality would have granted. Minor sidelines become the focus, the epicenter 
of meaning seemingly caves in from the self's perception as the self's comprehending 
processes rest on fundamentally different centralities, including the visual foci. 
What the self chooses to share with other selves is always a fraction of what 
truths the self believes in. There is no way for anything more than that fraction: 
besides from the required effort the self needs to expend to make for fuller and 
fuller explanations, the self has a need to guard beliefs and facts that would 
be disadvantageous to them if revealed to the other. To complicate the matter 
of the self's worldview, a collation of information operating in flux to produce 
multiple images for understanding, based so heavily on the self's recognized 
centralities, the self dons dualist mechanisms of behaviorial expression and 
cognitive processing. In virtually all cases, the self dons this duality and 
seeks to minimize as much opportunity for the other to know the characteristics 
of the duality in full. The self projects information in uni-directed modalities 
of comprehension, as to give the impression of a steadfast conviction in belief. 
The self retains dualist mechanisms for achieving completeness of the ways and 
forms, at the expense of the traits of  purity and singularity that are oftentimes 
recognized as the most genuine marks of honesty and goodwill. Duality, in 
historical use by human beings, serves as an overarching symptom of an immune system 
that operates on the ruthlessness of pragmatism, but could certainly be described 
in the idealistic terms of what is the predominant and what should be kept in 
reserve just in case. Duality compensates for the weakness of ideological purity, 
goes the thinking of many that adopt dualist tendencies into their modus operandi. 
By the phrase "weakness of ideological purity", take the phrase to mean the implicit 
restraints placed onto the self, whether due to the certain principles or lack of 
principles associated with the ideology's practice. The self that decides on using 
dualist mechanisms still intends to think and act as one in the whole, not one 
split in two ways by two halves. The robustness in behavior that the self seeks 
in duality is a result of the will driving self-interest. The pragmatics of 
compensation is a choice to go down the route of impurity, with the promise of 
achieving more and retaining more only due to the greater appreciation of ways 
and forms anti-thetical to one another, but together produces a self dynamic beyond 
the predictability of purity. The self has many issues to contemplate and handle, 
from a cognitive perspective, in dualist modus operandi. The will is what gives 
reminder to the self about their identity, a part of their self-interest. The 
will is what energizes the self to find difference in others' similar dualist 
tendencies, while for the self, their self-interest is self-justifying of their 
dualism. 

## More on philosophies of self-interest #26 

Self-interest has many attributes, not even of a constant number, variable to 
the whims of the self's will and the necessitated demands of the spatiotemporal 
context. Recognizing a thing, out of possible candidates, as a centrality is a 
preference for the self. Using dualist thought and behavior is a pragmatic choice. 
These two principles, of choosing centrality/ies and donning duality, no longer 
become generalizable to any self after the self puts them into their own existential 
practice. Using these two principles, the self is able to be their own ultimate 
agent in the acceptance and rejection of outcome. This is different from the 
statement that the self alone bears the expectation of succeeding or failing at 
any arbitrarily-defined task. Given the hindrances posed by some spatiotemporal 
circumstances, it would be reasonably foolish to expect one to be able to succeed 
at some task. But human beings seldom demand others to do things only because the 
demands are reasonable. On the contrary, the great prospect of watching a human 
being fail at something due to the odds stacked against them is what gives some 
adversaries sheer satisfaction in being witness to that specific kind of failure, 
typically also narrated back to the audience as foolhardy and hubristic. When the 
self becomes capable of exercising their own acceptance and rejection of outcomes, based 
on the centralities that they use in comprehension and judgment, and on the styles 
of expression in transparency or dishonesty by their dualist modus operandi, the 
self has a form of control unacquirable by others, yet this control is still vulnerable 
enough to be manipulable against their self-interest. Incorporating dualist mechanisms 
and finding new centralities still do not guarantee the self to become an independent 
agent, even when the question of such basics as food,water, and shelter are not 
part of the consideration. Unfortunately for those bent on achieving independence 
for themselves, there are no easy formulae to use for that objective, although many 
cases of achieving independence rely on certain staples obvious enough for there 
not be any need to explicitly mention. When the self relies on another, there are 
some rather predictable routes for outcomes. In the first two routes, the other 
assumes a regulatory/oversight role of hierarchical power over the self. The other 
could make "correct" use of a pertaining system to aid in judgments, recommendations, 
and other advice for the self. The other could also make "incorrect" use of a pertaining 
system, through discriminatory practices of misapplication and/or preferential 
application of system functions belonging to a system that otherwise is based on 
impeccable principle (but those impeccable principles are safeguards for nothing, as 
it turns out in some cases). In the third route, the other plays along by taking an 
auxiliary (secondary) role as a helper to the self. The self has a balancing problem 
to deal with in their involvement of an other into their efforts. The self believes 
themself to be inadequate, usually by spatiotemporal metrics, to accomplishing 
objectives that require as much scale as they do perfection. The self can reach a level 
of perfection, but the perfection is granular, constrained to orbit around the lone 
source, the self. By involving others, the self has to make due with possible lessening 
in quality and contentious/mixed agenda, such as collusion, favoritism, hyper-competition, 
and non-independence. In arrangements of relativity, the self can always be made out 
(conceptualized, narrated about) to be wrong, foolish, et cetera, by the other's use of 
statements that employ opinion while being fronted by illusion of fact. The self uses 
systems by their own strengths and preferences, and another self likewise but with the 
freedom to not be identical in use. As such, the same system when used differently is 
an antinomy between any two users of distinct styles and preferences. And that is in 
regards to only one system. The self becomes one forced to compromise for the greater 
ideal, when the self can do no things declared important without other accomplices. 
Compromise does not quite negate the innate righteousness of the self in their preferences. 
The self, being one with their self-interest above all, this so-called greater ideal, 
sees fault first in others, considers their self as first in the line of consideration, 
and is seldom not the last to admit fault. Admission of fault rarely ever makes sense 
to the self that knows the world can turn hostile against them very quickly, despite 
of what reason. The self, regardless of their cooperation with others, is a hypocrite 
after taking up dualist principles. From a singularist perspective, there is no need 
for duality except for dealing with conflicts of systemic inconsistency and hierarchy 
from the other, and the self knows how to state this in countless ways out of their 
self-interest.

What separates the force of self-interest from the practice of pragmatics is the 
fundamental ground of operation. Pragmatics is merely a body, of indeterminate 
size, of relational principles (non-axiomatic in other words) for use as a framework 
in decision-making. Thus, the pragmatic person may have habitually developed their 
pragmatism to encompass traits such as stoicism, mindfulness in calculation, and 
avoidance of endeavors recognized as vain and deluded, yet their pragmatism, being 
an outward practice of expression based on relational principles learned to aid in 
decisions of specific spatiotemporal circumstances, cannot be a part of their 
essential existence. This is in stark contrast to the force of self-interest, 
propelled by the will, for what the host believes is for their own good, the 
good oscillating somewhere between desiring for the gains of the collective 
and the gains of the self, as an indisputable form of selfishness. The host, 
by their self-interest, that vital force inseparable from sentience until death 
does them part, always has the option to take the pragmatic path, given the 
condition that the host knows what it means to be essentially pragmatic, 
instead of making decisions that coincide with increasing the chances of their 
survival. The pragmatist tends to be an informed decision-maker, so a human 
being that relies on coincidence to obtain their best possible decision simply 
cannot be pragmatic due to the chance that they never put any thought or practice 
into controlling for their self-interest. Those that act by their self-interest 
are not obliged to act pragmatically, for self-interest is a force that is a 
primary driver of what is arguably "free will" for human beings, naturally granting 
human beings the liberty to fight at great costs for their ideals that are 
coincidentally contrarian to orthodox pragmatic practices. The potential of 
achievements through pragmatism revolves around mastery of the relative and the 
relation. For instance, those that operate purely by their self-interest may 
find themselves lost for direction that yields them gain. Instead of gain, there 
is loss due to over-consumption, oversensuality, and miscomprehension of the 
abstract and noble ideal when the ideal is put into objective form. These errors
in decision-making are common for those that do not have the experience of 
contemplating their intrinsic weaknesses that cannot be resolved or ignored 
through efforts in the same direction, based on the directionality of their will 
in charge of advancing their self-interest. The individual, with their self-interest, 
may fall prey to their whim fostered by a will blind to the risks of their being 
deluded by their ideals. Self-interest, then, cannot be a sole determining force 
for a human being to understand what their long-term interests of gains are. Within 
this force of self-interest contains the irrationality of passion and personal 
belief. Without the guidance of pragmatic thought, those by their own self-interest 
can only learn the better path through first experiencing costly mistakes, and 
many of these mistakes cannot be rewinded back to the starting point before the 
costs have inflicted themselves in the manner of permanence. Pragmatism allows the 
self the opportunity to understand the means, in abstract and technical forms, 
that would allow them the greatest probabilities of achieving their vision, their 
ideal, through the emphasis on choosing the best relative degree for the pertaining 
issue and maintaining a mindfulness of the relations at play in the problem. 
The pragmatist seeks to define in terms of specifics, in order to cognitively pave 
the way before actually pursuing the way. This pre-definition is important in 
structuring the possibilities and the possibilities' corresponding decisions 
in a manner superior to resting one's modus operandi purely on the language 
of ideals, the loftiness of this kind of phrasing inconsiderate of the compromises 
and technicalities that are sure to come in real-world decision-making and 
application. Without the ideal, however, the self does not have to share the 
language and symbolism that transcends the self to integrate the vision and 
behavior of others. This could, in turn, prove problematic to the self as an 
agent amongst the collective that requires more than the technical minutiae 
of satisfying details to persist as a body operating under integrity. For 
the self with their self-interest, the dual needs to use the ideal to transcend 
the spatiotemporal mundanity and the pragmatics to set standards and definitions 
for achievement is a constant balancing act that becomes a factor many times 
in relevance, by the demands for empirical performance, to the force of 
self-interest lofty and senseless without the definition of pragmatics and 
ideals.

The difficulty in generalizing self-interest is due, in notable part, to 
the plasticity of human behavior given the cultural landscape and spatiotemporal 
resources available to the self. The connectivities an individual has with their 
surroundings, a great part of these surroundings being the artificial construct 
material or immaterial made by other human beings, demand the individual to 
adapt their styles of expression, to "conform" perhaps, in the same way that 
a puzzle piece must fit with its neighboring puzzle pieces in order to constitute 
the whole. The analogy of the puzzle piece is a gross simplification of the 
complexities that human societies of flux, economically and through other 
aspects of rapid mobilization, are capable of. But the analogy does imply that 
the individual is influenced by their society at large, in any directionality 
of positive (exaggerated) and negative (understated) expression of what their 
will advocates them to do. Those that are in positions of power relative to 
their fellow human being may find the decorum of niceties and endless layers 
of bureaucratic regulation ironically unwholesome because of excess and 
superficiality. These particular individuals, out of their self-interest 
to operate in haste and for immediate results impactful in messaging to others 
of their own power, do not base their actions on the obligation to appease 
and flatter. Other individuals, based on their socio-economic positioning, 
may actually have the same vanities and character flaws as those higher in 
rank to them. These other individuals may also crave power and seek to do 
harm to those disadvantaged. But ultimately, due to their obligation to 
remain fixed at their socio-economic positions, they cannot afford to show 
their faces of wickedness and excess in contradiction by challenge to those 
higher in rank to them. These broad generalizations of how individuals express 
themselves due to their socio-economic status, despite the similarities in 
objectives between their self-interests, is about the human being's utility 
of their available means as well as their constant need to satisfy hierarchical 
expectations, as part of their temperance from excess which may upset the order 
of their society at large. The concept of a "sphere of influence" is of an 
important reminder on the effecting potency of the individual in their preferences. 
The sphere of influence acts as a radius of effective power an individual 
has with respect to their vicinity. Any individual that uses the language of 
ideals to propagate their own vision onto the rest of the world discovers a 
harsh lesson in the reality of constraints that contain them because of the 
spatio-temporal limits, their sphere of influence. Their words of ideals can 
only go so far without there being misinterpretation. Furthermore, their words 
of ideals must manifest themselves in forms of examples instead of the purity 
that is incontrovertible yet also not specified enough to bear actual effect. 
Through paradigms such as the sphere of influence, what one individual believes 
is a selfish intrusion, masquerading under the language of ideals, according to 
the definitions of another individual based on their self-interest, for the order, 
that is, the greater good that is for collective instead of individual gain. 
The sphere of influence is an abstract structure that allows one individual to 
impose practices, stemming from their self-interest, and another individual to 
have to abide by those practices. This abstract structure is, in effect, one of 
the cornerstone paradigms for understanding the economizing of power according 
to self-interest, a force that may attempt to supercede in relevance of authority 
to the self-interests of others, or a force that, through the pragmatism of 
utmost consideration for the social construct, drives an individual to pretend 
one way to satisfy their aims of another wanted outcome.

The individual typically likes to project themself as a being of ideals, of 
those things that cannot be so easily quantified and outside of the ordinariness 
of the world's materialization. Regardless of what the individual really believes 
in, the individual that claims to stand by their professed metaphysical bodies 
of ideals is one that cannot be so conveniently rationalized by someone else. 
The ideal stands, is the reason, when all else can crumble because of the material 
impermanence. Stylistic forms of expression the individual takes up, as part of 
their participation in their respective sphere/s of influence, tend to exude 
the ideal, first and foremost, because the ideal is about as fundamental as 
the axiom, yet also serves as a testament to the transcendental nature of the 
individual past their potential of physical impact. The axiom, being an irreducible 
component of the body of natural law, serves as the "root" explanation of all 
natural phenomenon connected to it. The ideal, similarly, is the apex of human 
desire and human conception of infallibility, and thus serves the individual's 
constant need to justify the specifics of their possibly contradictory and 
hypocritical actions; it is the ideal that is fought for, that is to be aspired 
to, and for this to happen, sacrifices in the form of compromise and errors 
are inevitable, so goes the thinking of those that explain themselves in terms 
of their ideals instead of the minutiae of their actions. The sweetest actions, 
the greatest monstrosities throughout history have been committed in the name 
of the ideal. It is as if the ideal is a scientific axiom of objectivity for 
what free will the human has. But truthfully, how much span of free will can the 
human being have if their thoughts and actions are geared towards the ideal, or 
rationalized in retrospect as being for the ideal? This question is tricky to 
answer on the matter of the individual, one with their own self-interest. The 
will of the individual can be simply for justifying the individual by invocation 
of the ideal as the impeccable answer of brevity, instead of genuinely believing in 
the ideal, although the degree of genuine belief in anything, including the 
ideal, is not the only pre-requisite for leading a life instead of having one's 
life misguided by the symbols in practice associated with the ideal. Invocation 
of the ideal is a convenient solution for self-interest: explain away the misdeeds, 
misgivings, and other errors as something confusingly both unavoidable and 
necessary to fulfill the ideal through practice. In the usual course of these 
explanations, it is the practice, after resulting in unideal losses, that 
constitutes the proof of the individual being one with their self-interest 
in parallel support for the ideal.

Self-interest, as already noted, is driven by the individual's will. But there 
are some rather important emotive bodies, not yet explicitly named, that influence 
the will. On the negative end of the spectrum is fear. Fear is a classic irrational 
influencer of the will. Fear causes one, no matter the amount of information they 
have or the experiences they have had, to steer themselves, usually in ways not 
completely uncontrollable by their will, towards routes they have already recognized 
beforehand as decision sequences for the insane. Of course, fear is not an element 
that results in universal outcomes for all those that experience it. Many individuals 
have a seemingly perfect grasp over the influences that fear radiates. But the 
"power", for lack of a more encapsulating term, that fear exerts onto sentient 
cognition is most definitely not null, despite the apparent lack of symptoms the 
individual may express in response to fear. Due to fear, narratives are concocted 
to rationalize the unknown. Since the unknown cannot be properly rationalized because 
knowledge of it lacks in truthful substance, the narratives can only be structured 
to yield answers in the veins of probability or answers that are imprecise due to 
their reliance on metaphorical reasoning. One whose self-interest operates under 
fear is equivalently, one that has decided to de-emphasize their faculty of reason 
to proceed by their original answer. The example of the emotive body that is 
fear makes for a comprehensive discussion on the vulnerabilities of those that 
operate purely on their self-interest without the guardrails of default reasoning, 
the only surefire class of decision-making that can yield replicable and rationalizable 
solutions. The force of self-interest, in unrestrained or undisciplined practices, can 
be likened to a rabid animal that has lost its ability to recognize and correct its 
insanity, or to a fiend that has compulsive needs to satisfy their cravings of flesh 
or inanimate substance. A common question, usually asked with great wonder, is how 
someone that operates by their self-interest can make decisions so adverse to their 
livelihood of mind and body, even when there is opportunity of valuable information 
to make better decisions. This question is usually answered by psycho-analytic means, 
especially when there is not enough quantitative information to present explanation 
by the number and the figure. A simple answer rests on how the individual processes 
fear. By believing in the aura that fear radiates into them, the individual closes 
their mind to the outlets that would have granted them greater solution through decisions 
better because the decisions are more informed ones. The will can ward off fear, 
but could just as well let in fear as an influencer variable of the will, practically 
a controller of the will. The actualization of success by an individual with their 
self-interest is oftentimes very dependent on the constituents of their emotive 
state. There is fear that represses. And then there is confidence that motivates 
self-interest to proceed in resistive or forward ways. Both fear and confidence 
are emotive forces that seek to govern the will, by presenting the circumstances 
of unknown or incomplete empirical knowledge as an illusion in the directions 
of positivity (inflation as the willfully ignorant motivator of confidence) and 
negativity (deflation as the repressive fear). In the impartial perspective on 
the utility of emotive forces, such as fear and confidence, self-interest can 
be greatly disserviced by these forces' utility in the long run, where objectivity 
and empiricism yield solutions more durable because of their resting on rational bases, 
instead of the ephemeral power of spontaneity and personal motivation that these two 
emotive forces encourage. However, in the grand scheme of the concept of free will, 
the choice of the individual with their self-interest to rely on the tools of fear and 
confidence, as makers and breakers of the illusions that drive them to act in any 
direction of decision, cannot be truly eradicated. Dictates for self-interest to not 
rely on emotive forces are vain because the choice to let in these forces is an innate 
part of sentient existence; to conclude, sentient thought and action is not confined 
to the rules of stoicism.

The narrative is a powerful tool in relation to self-interest. Such power is factually 
only effective on the cognitive processes of an individual. To clarify though, cognition, 
being the process that yields the first step to any serious thought or action, cannot 
be underestimated or overestimated without there also occurring errors in judgment, 
and judgment gives way to decisions that are impactful to collective perception and 
physical existences. The narrative changes the individual's perception and perspective. 
The reason for this occurrence of cause (the narrative) to effect (the changes onto 
perception and perspective) is simple to understand: the narrative contains centralities 
for cognition to recognize as motives, objectives, and symbols, and those that believe 
in the narrative must also perceive things differently enough to accomodate the persuading 
messages of the narrative. Likewise, the perspective of the believer in the narrative 
also undergoes changes, evidenced by the believer's language used, the ideals they claim 
to now uphold, and the methodologies that they feel they have a right to use, all due 
to the narrative. Some common uses of the narrative are to ascribe constructed objectivity 
to that which otherwise can only be opinionated on given the facts at disposal, to draw 
conclusions on the matters that otherwise can only be speculated on due to the missing 
of vital facts. The narrative fills in the holes of missing information, removes plausible 
sources of doubt, uses language of collective acceptance or traditionalist practice to 
advance points by rational-like expression, and offers direction of morality and action to 
those individuals susceptible to believing the narrative, out of what the individuals 
believe is for the betterment of themselves based on their self-interest, in which 
case their will is for advancing the procedures of reactionary follow-up from the narrative. 
On the use of the narrative for constructive purposes, the self that feels lost or at 
odds with the course of their life's trajectory can be made to accept the realities of 
their situation by the perspective embedded in the narrative they have interpreted as 
fact by their belief. The narrative, for purposes of positive construction, offers 
an explanation through the reality of purported opportunities for the self to 
elevate their stature. There is more than grim facts of details, void of implication 
and causality, that the narrative offers. The narrative can be used to give a sense 
of righteousness to self-interest, that force that is not dependent on scruples to 
operate. The narrative, as a tool of positive construction for the self, instills 
confidence in the self to act by their self-interest, and also to perpetuate fears 
based on the irrationalities of distortion into those adversarial to the self. 
In any complex situation, there are many perspectives that can be formed to 
interpret said situation. The narrative can give a sense of closure to the 
individual that feels torn by the plurality of contradicting interpretation, 
through the details selected in the manner of half-truths and other kinds of 
distortions to validate the individual's sense of their own merit, a positive 
elevator for their self-interest. Because the narrative is not required to be 
based on fact, the narrative could always be constructed to push the perspective 
that suits the desires of the individual's expectations. Without the narrative, 
self-interest has only facts and interpretations gathered from their perception. 
There is still yet the question of the proceeding, the objective that should be 
attempted because of those facts and interpretations. Thus, the narrative removes 
the self's need to continue their contemplation of morality and reason. And without 
any further restraints, the self could very well completely act for the implications 
and means pushed by the narrative, for what they believe is for the best, given 
their self-interest.

There exist strong relations between the social constructs that human beings 
create, based on their acceptances and postulations of social theory, and the 
sphere of influence, how these social constructs operate in radiating manner 
from agents of the social construct onto other agents of the same social construct, 
as well as the narrative, one of the prime tools that spheres of influence use 
to foster belief for what is deemed the appropriate thought and action given a 
world that rests on probabilities and the elevation of one's judgment over the 
judgment of others. The social construct of human understanding, devised and practiced 
by humans, is the apex of human will's conceptualization for order in thought and 
behavior, both of which have freedoms that are not ordered by natural law, instead 
a utility of the constants that comprise natural law. The social construct is what 
gives unifying meaning to phenomenon, for all beings in that construct to participate 
in for equality of belief, that otherwise would be interpreted by an individual 
through their own perception, yielding answers that are subjective in the way of 
opinion to others. Unlike natural phenomena that rests their actualization on the 
constants that comprise natural law, the human being seems to always have a choice 
to think or do some thing. There is a lack of default reason, cause-and-effect that 
is fixed and derived entirely from natural law, in human thought and behavior. In 
fact, oftentimes, the human being, due to their self-interest, commits some action 
that is both costly to themself and damaging to others, but then that same human 
being justifies their action as something within their rights, an expression out 
of their ethics self-professed as necessary, explanations that really cannot be 
rationalized in the manner of propositional logic or calculus as being purely "good", 
as in "optimal", given the resources and the choice available to them. Social values 
are the first thing to be considered in relations between human beings, the most 
frequent aspect to be disagreed upon due to the openness in interpreting the artificial 
axiom, the rule that is not at the same fundamental level as those of natural law 
yet still declared by human societies to be of the same correctness given the social 
construct; the quality of openness in interpreting the artificial axiom is itself 
probably an axiom on par with natural law, due to the many special cases stemming from 
the sheer number of possibilities from spatiotemporal preference in choice. Conventionally, 
any science outside of the fundamental hard sciences (that is what natural law is understood as) 
cannot be anymore than a soft science due to the freedoms of negotiating and 
formulating the rules in ways arbitrary to nature yet seemingly most fitting for 
the belief systems that the corresponding society adheres to. Social constructs, 
especially spheres of influences, are for the purpose of structuring the subjective 
into the belief of fact. But at their default disposal are not the irreducible axioms, 
but rules of relativity and agreeableness. Economic concepts such as zero-sum and 
non-zero sum make themselves very present as ways to form objective and meaning of what 
is right or wrong, given the finite resources and the ever-present disputability of 
actions fallible by preference of one over the other in the context of what 
is universally recognized as vice. Zero-sum decision-making acts as a template for 
justifying the double-standard: doing what would be unequivocally considered wrong 
to one's self or one's group (their sphere of influence) is, on the contrary, 
completely within their rights to inflict upon another, due to such aspects as 
survivalism, in other words, necessary competition such that the higher moral 
principles are forced to be ignored in order to tend to the livelihood of the 
self and their sphere of influence. The narratives that a sphere of influence 
espouses, these same narratives that the self usually also upholds as part of 
their belief system, for their self-interest of course, allow for prioritization 
of certain courses of action and attention (the centralities) that the society 
is to take. The self, always a servant to their self-interest, must always be 
keen on the narratives of the social construct they preside in. The narrative 
is what gives the first impression, by transforming details of mundanity and 
incredulity alike into the image of preferred symbols and morals to be regarded 
in the same vein as natural law, although they are borne from the realm of 
sentient interpretation. The narrative gives the collective unified meanings 
on the infinitessimal grades of information with respect to the situation/s. 
For the individual with their self-interest, there are compromises bound for 
them to participate in, as a stipulation of their membership in the social 
construct that operates synonymously as one or more spheres of influence. 
What is truth for the self then, if the truth goes against the noble lie, 
or the noble's lie? What is "taking the higher road" then, when the agents 
of a social construct have decided to condemn any individual to damnation 
here on planet Earth if the individual were to embark on their "higher road" 
instead of the socially acceptable road? Here in this elaboration on the 
intersection of the social construct, the sphere of influence, and the 
narrative, the individual with their self-interest does not have to be 
a servant only to their self-interest, but also be an agent of plasticity 
for satisfying the social rules of relativity and agreeableness. And the 
self, being one with their self-interest, typically takes up the liberty 
of justifying the compromises they felt forced to make, a stipulation 
of their membership in the social construct, as something optimal and correct 
due to and because of their self-interest.

Reasoning by common sense points to the force of self-interest as the 
metaphysical culprit for a sentient being's selfishness. The sentient 
being, by their self-interest, has the power to act freely within the 
constraints of their spatiotemporal setting. The idea that self-interest 
is a force that naturally leads to one exhibiting selfishness is based, 
first and foremost, on the host of self-interest being that one, the self, 
so that all thought and behavior done by that self can naturally be traced 
back to them, and these efforts are usually to benefit the self out of 
the pragmatic to prioritize the self above others, even in collectivist 
societies, perhaps especially in collectivist societies since no one 
loves the self in these societies as much as the self from their 
self-interest. Selfishness can be understood by the partitioning of 
quantity, between the self and others. The selfish value their views 
above others, and also aspire for power and material value of magnitudes 
disproportionately for them at others' loss. However, if one's self-interest 
is the only factor to consider them as a being that is more selfish than 
not, then claims of their being selfish cannot proceed by any rational 
argument. Self-interest is the force that could give to others as much 
as that to the self. In certain constructs, especially in those that 
operate by non-zero sum, there is actually a pronounced stigmatization 
of those that disproportionately serve themselves over others. The ideal 
in these non-zero sum constructs is that of equal distribution, of fair 
and accurate reciprocity, and of holding the "selfless" act as higher in 
ethical integrity than the selfish act. On the last point of the "selfless" 
act, such labeling seldom goes without there being misconception. The 
"selfless" act is committed by one that still operates by their self-interest. 
The source that is the driving force for a selfless act is the same as that 
of the selfish act, namely self-interest. One way to differentiate an 
action is being selfish as opposed to selfless is by a weighted scheme that 
takes as variables the qualities of reference from said action to the acting 
self. Some variables are easier than others to judge on the spectrum of 
selfless to selfish, such as financial values and material resources. 
Variables that deal with the metaphysical, however, are subject to 
interpretation. For example, one that claims to have conducted an action 
to fulfill their ideal could be classified as being selfless, for they 
took the action for the ideal that exists outside of their sole existence, 
in apparent disregard for their existence. However, if the criteria is that 
one's believed ideals are a part of their self, then one that commits actions 
for what they claim to be for their ideals is selfish by the direct connection 
of fulfilling the ideal being coincidentally efforts to fulfill the self. By 
this strict association of the ideal with the self-interest, the direction of 
gains intended by the self, regardless of any invoked ideal, is towards the 
self. As an example, some human beings find a sense of satisfaction 
in being charitable or empathetic, both of these adjectives being ideals. And 
although the actions that can be labeled charitable or empathetic are not in 
complete reference to the self but to the other, the fact that the self finds 
a sense of satisfaction from the exchange to the other means that the self 
cannot be logically excluded from being categorized as selfish; the ratio 
in preferring the self over the other in acts of charity and empathy seldom 
is ever zero, as in being completely selfless. Such is the fact of sentient 
existence always necessitating a consideration for the self, out of self-interest, 
even in exchanges inarguably more selfless than not. There are inexact 
correlations between the spectrum of selfless to selfish and the spectrum of 
ideal to pragmatic, and as such, every time there is an attempt to categorically 
label an individual as being selfless, void of the attribute of selfishness 
often considered a societal vice, the questions of the involved ideals and 
pragmatics, as influential forces at play in the social construct as well as 
the psyche of the individual, have to also be pondered on for wholesome and 
non-skewed judgment of the individual. In quantitative terms, there is always 
something that could be quantified as a payoff to the self for acting more so 
in the interest of their self or the interest of others, both of these routes' 
efforts spurred by the force of the self's self-interest. The prioritization by 
the self, through thought and action, for their self or for others still bears 
the direct link back to the self. To conclude, the self, through their self-interest, 
does what they feel and think fit, oftentimes. Accurately labeling one as being 
more selfish or more selfless requires the weighted consideration of the pertaining 
variables, but even then, there is room for interpretation that is due not only 
to the whims and objectives of the culture, the collective, but also to the 
individual judges of character. The arguments for a specific one's self-interest 
to be a force for their selfish gain have to remain as subjective notions for 
factual clarity, unless quantification that is complete and accurate in the 
consideration of variables, in the scope of the partitioning between the self and 
the others, takes place. Even so, such quantification for social matters on social 
terms is a matter that takes as precedent in importance the design over the raw 
facts, those details that require interpretation (through the design) for 
labeling by social terms.

Self-deprecation consists of acts by the self, naturally counter-intuitive in 
its rationalization. Why would one place efforts towards debasing their image 
for the perception by others? Take the concept of self-deprecation a few steps 
further in the direction of negativity, and interpretation on that individual 
would quickly shift from their being self-deprecating to their exhibiting a 
self-hatred or a self-loathing. The individual, in their acknowledgment of their 
own mortality and finiteness, would not be naturally inclined by their self-interest 
to deprecate their self. Quantitatively, self-deprecation makes the minor flaw 
into a sort of irreconciliable difference, the near-perfection into the forever 
flawed. Self-deprecation is for alteration of one's image that they want to 
project to the external world, full of other perceptual beings with their 
own perspectives and methods of interpretation. However, the topics of 
self-deprecation seldom rest solely with the one deprecating their self. 
If the insults and mockery of self-deprecation were to be geared entirely against 
the self, then by common sense, any individual that engages in self-deprecation 
would, in fact, be committing assassination of their own character. Despite 
the superficiality of the image individuals and groups attempt to project about 
themselves to others, the image once tarnished is difficult to restore to the 
same degree and nature of idealism before the effacement, especially if the source 
of the effacement persists. Self-deprecation, as something that affects only the 
self that commits it, would not be practical for self-interest. In practice, 
self-deprecation works its effects, not contained only to the self that uses 
it, by appealing to the propensities of others' conceptual identities. The topics of 
self-deprecation are frequently those categorized as the universal concept, 
practiced by virtually all societies structured in some form of socio-economic 
implementation, such as "chivalry", "honor", "honesty", "modesty", "servitude", 
and "status". As such, when one expresses their self-deprecation by these 
universal concepts, it is not only them that is referentially impacted by their 
insult. The thematic broadness of self-deprecation affects all those that abide, 
in some manner of thought and action, to the universal concept that is either 
alluded to or explicitly mentioned. Techniques of self-deprecation propagate 
effect through a few vectors: humor, commonality, and revelation. The indirectness 
of one using self-deprecation to effect insult onto the other/s has certain 
advantages to it. For one, the other that is referenced by the insult does 
not have the basis of substance from the self-deprecating to state that they 
are being insulted without admitting to their faults alluded to. There cannot 
be much opportunity to denounce the self-deprecating as one that "stooped 
low enough" to use ad hominem attacks, for quite literally, the self-deprecating 
are using themselves as the subject of their insults. What insults perceived 
by others are due to their interpretation of reference alluding to their own 
behaviors and way of living, so there must be first acknowledgment from the 
others that the self-deprecating is indirectly portraying them in some negative 
light. Comparatively, the use of ad hominem attacks is conventionally viewed 
as clearly antagonistic due to the qualities of bluntness and sharpness directed 
at some individual or group, thus giving that individual or group logical 
justification to denounce the user of ad hominem as clearly belligerent, clearly 
malicious in spirit of intent. Self-deprecation, besides from being a strategy of 
indirect criticizing the other based on the other's intersection with the 
universal concept that they, according to the self-deprecating, have put into 
grotesque, perverse, and dishonest practice exclusively for their self-interest 
in utter contempt of all else, also acts as an illusory defense for the 
self-deprecating. The self-deprecating, out of their need to maintain the 
appearance of harmlessness (no threat through superiority in quality), uses 
the strategy of self-deprecation. To avoid accusations from others of their 
supposedly egoistic ways, coincidentally and intentionally fallible, the 
self-deprecating insults themselves by way of presenting their conditions 
and circumstances as half-truths (exaggerations, understatements, derogatory 
metaphors) leaning towards the negative light, such as inadequacy and stupidity, 
in order to portray themselves as ones both humble and modest in how they view 
themselves, not in the way of superior status that is often cause for adversarial 
envy. Self-deprecation, a deflationary illusion technique of the self onto the 
self done for their self-interest, is metaphorically something like a double-edged 
sword. Through the collateralism of simultaneously referencing the self and the 
other through mocking the other's practice of the universal concepts, the other 
is also subject to deflationary interpretation by their being insulted. Likewise, 
the use of self-deprecation, as a metaphorical shield, can also be driven by the 
self-interested's need to defend their image from claims of egoism and other 
qualitative personal attacks.

Continuing on with the discussion from part 34, self-deprecation can be 
categorized as antagonistic techniques, one that literally but insincerely 
attacks the self for actually attacking an other based on the universal 
concept's reference to them. As already mentioned, the objective of those 
that practice self-deprecation is rarely to assassinate their own character, 
and the criticizing power of such practices must therefore transfer over 
by negative light onto others based on their commonalities with the concepts 
expressed by the self-deprecating. Any antagonistic action employed by 
the self is, by defaults resting on questionable notions such as moral 
relativism, challengeable by interpretation subjecting said actions into 
the realm of doubt on their correctness. There is the classic saying, 
"two wrongs do not make a right", rather simple to understand from 
an arithmetical perspective, although such wisdom has never produced any 
conclusive righteousness of both ends in the longevity of time. Despite 
the inherent freedoms (the default autonomies of the individual life) that 
the self of any individual is granted in their thinking and taking action, 
there are some principles that can reliably predict how an individual would 
appear and actually behave as an antagonist for their self-interest of 
domination or maintaining power with respect to another. The self, by their 
self-interest, acts by relativity to the existing power dynamics that contain 
them. One that is part of the rule over sentient beings, for example, must 
take care to not appear as excessively cruel and prejudiced, for these 
appearances that may in actuality be true do build rationale for resistance 
to the rule. It is for this reason that the self, if put into 
positions of consolidated power and privilege over others, outwardly 
restrains their offenses not only because the social system they are put 
in charge of already does the work of brutal oppression and elegant 
persuasion of those unruly, but also because of such things as the risk 
of their losing to the challenger as grounds for their deposition. The 
infrastructure that these selves are in official control of also grants 
them the metaphorical tentacles to inflict impact much more than by their 
direct hands. Frequent courses of action for the ruler/s forced to deal 
with sentient beings viewed as problematic are via "playing things with 
class", meaning to do things as elegant as possible by their capabilities, 
such that their flaws in their practice of power are not conveniently 
traceable by others that would then reproduce evidence that posits the 
treachery of the ruler/s. On the converse, the self that is part of a 
challenger movement to those officially part of the rulership is not 
beholden to the pragmatic of outward restraint. In the spectrum of 
liberation to conservation, the self as a challenger is undeniably part 
of the liberation. There is a status quo that the self, as a challenger, 
feels that they must challenge, as part of their own rights, thus straying 
from the path of conservation to be the first-mover in offense against 
the status quo. From the perspective of the challenger self, the conservation 
has disserviced them. They, by their self-interest, have the questionable 
liberty of seeking retribution for this disservice, so by whatever means 
they think necessary to inflict as much destabilizing offense that they 
feel fit, for "the ends justify the means", their self-interest is the 
force behind their challenge to the status. The perplexity of understanding 
the self, when they are in the role of a challenger instead of a ruler, 
revolves around the perceived flaws they are attempting to correct. 
The system of the status quo does not suit the self, based on the beliefs 
generated from their self-interest. Self-justifying selves would therefore 
reason, whatever flawed means they used and are to use to antagonize 
the adversary in charge of their social construct and all the miseries 
wrought onto them, pale in the relativity of comparison to the qualitative 
flaws of the rulership and their erroneous abuses. Self-interest, as a 
force for the non-total self, being subject to the conditions of the 
default social construct, oscillates between acting as a controller 
of circumstances (rulership), possibly verging on despotic behavior 
if not "unquestionable" dictatorship, to being an agent of outward offense 
when they are a challenger to the rulership. The objective remains the 
same for the political self, regardless of their being the ruler or 
the challenger: power. Obtaining if not retaining power in their wanted 
form.

The artificial axiom can never be on the same low-level of natural 
instantiation as the axiom, the unit of source for the cause, the 
indisputable principle of the natural world, a world that behaves and 
appears less natural by the constructs and mannerisms devised and adhered 
to by sentient beings, based on their will. These constructs and mannerisms 
do reason to be arbitrary because of the premise that they can exist or 
be actualized because of natural law, but they are based on reasoning 
very unlike the indisputability of natural law, in the way of abidement 
to the axiom's constant dynamic and the universal formula for the cause, 
such as the condition/s that consistently activate the axiom's actualization. 
There is no inherent consistency in the actualization (execution, usage) of 
the artificial axiom; the artificial axiom is a design by sentience to be 
used for the orders and constructs established by sentience. Any principle 
past the hard sciences, and especially past economic principles of finiteness and 
zero-sum, into the realm of cooperation as non-zero sum is an artificial axiom 
devised by an impure combinatorial fusing of socially acceptable views, still 
requiring the voluntary will to be actualized, and the indisputable natural. 
The artificial axiom does not automatically act, as in autonomous systems that 
rely on consistency in the makings of their automation as effect from the cause 
that moves them. There is will involved in order for the artificial axiom to 
bear relevance. Without the will of sentience, the artificial axiom fails to 
remain relevant, forgotten and metaphorically tossed aside into the abysses 
of the nullified obsolete. Some examples of human practices are necessary to 
shed light on the notion of the artificial axiom not being automatic. Money 
is not automatically distributed to those in poverty, but the state, based on 
the will of its people, could take the effort to. Poverty is strongly associated 
with vice, encouraging crimes such as robbery and murder for capital, and as 
such, any developed society recognizes poverty as a chief detriment, against 
every one's self-interest. Yet, those in poverty are not automatically given 
enough capital to persist in the way of affording housing or food, just because 
there is the artificial axiom declared by human beings that poverty must be 
eradicated. Additional effort, outside of verbal and written declaration of 
this artificial axiom, must be enacted in order for those in poverty to receive 
the capital they so desperately need to meaningfully continue to survive. Another 
example is privilege to the individual, privilege granted to the individual on 
legal basis. Privilege is not guaranteed to the individual, despite the legal 
basis, synonymously artificial axioms. The individual must maintain both the 
knowledge that they have certain privileges in defense from the unrightful 
intrusion by others, and also to express their privilege as a fixture of 
their existence to others. Sentient will is involved in erecting and maintaining 
privilege. On a similar note, it is through the lack of will for reason and 
the pursuit of happiness that plunges individuals and societies alike into the 
despair of lowliness relative to their fellow human being. One key operational 
characteristic separates the axiom, a constituent of natural law, and the 
artificial axiom. The axiom serves as the irreducible and unpreventable 
principle, such that if a condition fitting to the axiom were to occur, this 
condition being the cause, then naturally, the effect borne from the axiom's 
application onto the cause occurs. There is no sentient will involved that 
can deter the effect from the cause. A human being, for example, hit in the 
heart by a multitude of high-caliber bullets has no chance of survival, despite 
their unquantifiable will to live. The cause (the multitude of high-caliber 
bullets) bears the effect of this human being's death, due to the axioms 
of kinetics and biological mortality from brute force. The artificial axiom, 
on the other hand, relies on a different category of causality chain. 
There is the cause, that is the human thought, action, and/or appearance, 
and then there is the sentient will necessary to connect the cause to 
the effect prescribed by the artificial axiom. With no will to connect 
the cause to the prescribed effect, the cause of human effort or appearance 
does not automatically (with no need for sentient will) lead to said effect. 
And the self, in general, focuses their will for their self-interest. If 
the self believes their self-interest does not benefit much by their will's 
application into connecting the artificial axiom's cause to the effect, 
then there is a strong chance they will do nothing, or even prevent the 
prescribed effect from actualizing due to the cause. The artificial axiom 
makes for many questions on the concept of free will. It is constructed 
based on the premise of the interests of many selves, a collective 
self-interest, envisioned by supporters to be a fixture for the sphere 
of influence they all participate in. But the artificial axiom is 
semi-automatic, at most. The application of "free will" is used in cases 
that invoke the artificial axiom, where the dichotomies of proposition and 
opposition to the prescribed effect become matters phrased in terms 
of choice for self-interest, in tandem with the interests of the 
involved other selves.

Self-interest is one force, the vital force immortally connected to the 
self, for the self cannot cease in one form without the corresponding 
self-interest attached also ceasing in that same form, that is obviously 
not self-contained, proven by the points made from the beginning of this 
text until this point. The courses of action taken and the thinking done 
by every sentient being can all be traced back to the force of self-interest. 
In mathematical terms, this tracing is not a one-to-one mapping. Self-interest
is indeed responsible for all phenomena expressed by every sentient lifeform, 
based on their will susceptible to misguidance, from external stimuli, 
and operational malfunction via their own limbs and bodily organs. For 
the sake of the self, the will must always be aligned with what they 
believe to be their self-interest, if the self were intent on their 
wanted outcome. The objective self is always intent on the outcome; this 
is a safe assumption for this kind of self since their true objective 
first cognitively constructed by them is supposed to be executed to 
their wanted degrees of success, lest they are either lying to themself 
about the destinations they intend to arrive at or they are, in fact, 
incapable, such that their stated objective is not even minutely 
feasible, so they are actually not an objective self but a deluded 
idealist of a self. The self is by default, as an agent of change in 
ways attributed on the spectrum enclosed by ordinariness and radicality, 
torn between the ideal of maximizing their potential (inherent talents 
and nurtured skills) and satisfying the pragmatic of being a fellow 
equal amongst different equals of other selves. This simple characterization 
of the duality between this specific ideal and this specific pragmatic 
is merely a stub, to clarify, a baseline convention. Practices labeled 
either pragmatic or ideal do require a certain coherence of the self with 
their surroundings, with other selves in contexts of competition and 
cooperation, and what is "pragmatic" or "ideal" is incontrovertibly 
connected to the demands, of arbitrary source, onto the self. The demands 
are a crucial determinant in the actualities of pragmatism and idealism 
for the self's quantifiable gains. And the demands, placed onto the self, 
cannot always be borne from the self's lone self-interest, void of influence 
from the interests of other selves. This terse statement is yet another 
rephrasing and proof of the self, as in the human self, having to play 
the role of the "social creature", a label of truth constant to them so 
long as there are at least two selves in contact with one another.

The category called "mannerism" plays a rather important part in human 
behavior. The usage of this term, "mannerism", should not be interpreted 
strictly as the artistic style from 16th century Italy. Truthfully, mannerism 
is much more than that, and although the 16th century Italians did indeed 
effectively capture and reproduce many messages, through their artistic 
depictions on the concept of mannerism, these successes are culturally relative 
in the scope of human societies spanning the globe. The proceeding discussion 
on mannerism is entirely about the general principles of mannerism in relation 
to self-interest, and does not make any further mention of this Western European 
nation, Italy, no matter its significance as a region since the beginning of 
history. The mannerist is a conservative agent in a few important aspects. The 
mannerist has references to replicate and thus adhere to. These references have 
been established through the historicity of styles that the mannerist's society 
has either retained or adopted. References include the custom, the ideological 
traits of the culture, and the archetypes for each socio-economic class' preferred 
behavior, this constituting definitive traits to recognize manner. The mannerist 
believes in restraining their will to act by impulse, in favor of the form that 
has been taught to them, then repeatedly expressed to them as the preferred 
pose of behavior and thinking that they should seldom divert away from. The 
mannerist, as an agent of change, can only go so far as reform rather than 
outright revolt. For the mannerist, there is already a reference to achieve 
the ideal in practice. Whatever societal change they are attempting is for the 
purpose of guiding their society back to the decorum of the manner. As such, 
the mannerist, in their objective to reform, is also categorically a moralist, 
albeit one with greater concern for cultural relativity over the universal 
good, more so than an ideologue with a singleminded vision of actualizing on 
their ideals by willfully blinding themselves to the cost, the cost being a 
great consideration for the mannerist tied to their moral in a world where 
relativity is invoked to counter resistance against what is deemed the necessary 
vice. The mannerist always attempts to avoid being put into the light of 
relativity, for this kind of light would place doubt on their preferences for 
the decorum, and this doubt then carries over to their qualitative character 
of being comprehended by others. The perception by the self of their surrounding 
mannerism is almost entirely correlated, in the sense of a deterministic mapping, 
to how the mannerism affects their self-interests. If the self were to, for 
instance, not be welcomed as a participant to certain organizations since 
although they may practice the manner of those organizations, they do not 
possess the inherent attributes that position them to benefit from the manner, 
then the possibility of the self rejecting the mannerism becomes greater. 
From their self-interest, the mannerism is a legitimized roadblock 
that restricts the wanted actualization of potential from the self. Conformity 
is the default decision of the mannerist; the mannerist presents themself in 
the accepted forms of attitudes and appearances, these being the references. 
These references of the practiced attitudes and appearances have taken on 
an idealism through valuation by the respective social sphere/s of influence. 
The mannerist's solution for the question of behavior, this consisting of 
acts in great part for appearance, and the entirety of the appearance is 
comprised of these references, the form out of many possibilities that serves 
as the best realism of practicing the ideal. Mannerism values the perceived 
appearance of the sentient being as the centrality of all evidence for judgment. 
The manners are the artificial axioms in mannerism, understood to be not as 
a choice to prefer but analogically, something very much like the gold standard 
out of the possible span of material goods, that is, the optimal, the discovered 
best that should be valued higher than the practices of the self if the self 
is positionally incapable of the manners. The mannerist, being one that 
comprehends other human beings by reliance on their perception of the human 
beings' appearances, uses the practice of correspondence theory in order to 
label particular appearances in divisions of dichotomy and greater dimension. 
This reliance is, in turn, ripe for vulnerability in accurate judgment: not 
all phenomena can be captured by perception, and this tenet naturally presupposes 
that not all human appearance, through behavior and pose, can be registered by 
perception. Furthermore, mannerism is pre-deterministic, similar to how proper 
mathematical problems already have solutions and only require a critical mind 
trained in quantitative techniques in order for the answers to be revealed, 
the ideal from the righteous practice. Mannerism can act as an effective 
front for deception and abuses of power. These two issues of mannerism can 
be reduced to errors in judgment by the practice of correspondence theory. 
In application of correspondence theory, the manner, that is the attitude and/or 
appearance, signifies a positive ideal, in other words, a virtue or moral 
infallible by conceptual integrity, yet inclined towards faultiness by practice, 
but through the trial-and-error, the manner emerges as the best practice of the 
positive ideal. Expressing the manner is reasoned as expressing the good, the 
ideal by the best realism. The manner is a mark of high civilization, something 
reasoned to have been adopted on the premise that it is good (the only reason 
why the manner was adopted). The manner is a defense against particular 
possibilities available to the sentient being with the constant problem of 
having to deal with their impulses, vices in great portion when related to 
the ideal standing of the manner. In other words, the manner that becomes a 
fixture for social acceptability represses particular potentials of behavior 
in human beings. But from a fatalistic perspective, the potential is still 
there, and the potential must still manifest (actualize) itself (that is the 
"natural" course of the span of existence for the potential). In terms of 
prevention, mannerism values the manner but does not guarantee prevention 
of action chains labeled as vice. The potential for these alternatives 
still manifest itself, in the shadows rather than the light that the mannerist 
society of official standing thinks they have sole ownership of. The manner 
could still serve as a mask to hide the motive, and in this aspect, 
deception through pretense and impostor usage branches out into prevalent 
issues in mannerist society. Acquiring education in the manner is a 
socio-economic privilege, but education of any kind is, first and 
foremost, instruction. Through the communication of instruction used 
to grow awareness of the manner's existence and to nurture its practice, 
the one performance trait that can be measured is the expression, 
not the understanding of acceptance for the reasoned virtue that produced 
the manner in the first place. In a general but related sense, there is the 
frequent rationale that the principle can be easily taught, but the choice to 
accept the moral as a fixture for sentient decision is a question of the 
individual's acceptance. The mannerist is an exteriorist: the exterior of 
the pose in the style of the manner is what takes priority, since internalist 
rationales as well as the trial-and-errors have already produced the solution 
that is the manner, the most appropriate. The self, as a functioning member 
in human societies, is recognized by the attribute of the roles and 
responsibilities they must play. To exemplify, the self in servitude to 
an organization recites phrases promoted by the organization, dresses and 
poses in ways representative of the organization. The self, if belonging to 
an elite class, uses language the elite class uses, subscribes to the same 
channels, buys the same products, all this indicative of conformity. A parallel 
description can be made for the self of a middle or low socio-economic class. 
However, to clarify, mannerism is the representation of the respective 
civilization's cultural hallmark. There are elitist elements attached to 
mannerism. The self, by default connected to a physically separate being, 
does not inherit knowledge of the manner, only perhaps a compass of morality 
that accepts the manner. The style is a cultural design, and so too must be 
the manner because the manner is a preferred style for the conceptual ideal 
it is to represent. Self-interest, as a force for the will of the human being, 
synonymously the "social creature", has the tendency to choose mannerism 
over their own originality, when the objective is to represent rather than 
discover, to uphold the legacy rather than re-design, and to value the 
group identity that practices the manner over the identities of others. 
Mannerism challenges the self's independent choice, free from the prescriptions 
set forth by the manner. Thus, the self may discover that their adherence 
to the manner, although conducive to their greater social acceptance, results 
in deficits of their individuality and possibly their authenticity, measured 
by their cognitive and emotive connection to the vessel of their body, since 
the expression of potential possible from the inherent strengths of the 
individual is not maximalized, even ignored and forgotten, when there is 
little alignment between the manner and the individual trait. 

## More on philosophies of self-interest #39 

Self-interest, although self-driven through the will, as the force from 
one's will that is one layer above the one's motivation, can be manipulated. 
The reason for this manipulation is due to the directionality of the will 
being manipulable. By simple logic, the change in the input (the will) 
necessarily changes the output (qualities of self-interest such as the 
objectives). Some may argue that motivation is dependent on the will, 
instead of the converse that this text supposes. The semantics of language 
allow there to be differences in defining motivation and the will. The 
reason why this text places the will as dependent on motivation is due 
to the catalytic power of motivation. Motivation is a sort of metaphysical 
predecessor fuel for all actionable decisions made by the self. The will 
may be what is responsible for the self to decide on an option, out of 
their self-interest. But without the motivation, the will lacks an inherent 
drive to proceed with for executing the decision. Plants, for example, have 
the will to grow once their seed has sprouted. But the growth of the plant 
is purely physical, the growth of fibers into stems and branches connected 
to the root. Why would the plant not develop locomotion, or produce the fruits 
of different species, or naturally merge with other plants instead of competing 
for resources of soil and water? The plant does not do any of these things 
in the previous question, because the motivation of the plant propels its 
will to express development as growth in the formula that motivation is 
already definitively attached to. The growth is for the form of the plant's 
species. In biological terms, motivation would be equated to the biological 
code of RNA and DNA, so that if the potential is there, there is a determinism 
at play that does not allow development of the life past a threshold of 
divergence. Motivation is not equivalent to the biological code of RNA and DNA, 
but the similarity is mentioned to differentiate the determinism of motivation 
from that of will. The will can be directed towards one thing but through its 
use, something else emerges, so there is the discrepancy between the expected 
and actual; how the actual can be rationalized as the outcome from determinism 
is an argument to be made by the fatalist. This difference between the expected 
and the actual is due to one or more of three culprits: the will as something 
confused by the associated self, the self-interest as misguided by the use of 
the will in a directionality improper towards the expected, or the motivation 
is not there for the will of wants and desires converged into expectation unmet. 
Then according to this text's description, when the terms "will" and 
"motivation" are swapped for one another's definition, the "will" is a 
dependency for "motivation". One point of confusion on "self-interest", 
"will", and "motivation" is the cognitive awareness by the self of these 
forces. The self always has a conceptualization of their self-interest, 
although they might not know the consequences of acting on what they 
comprehend to be their self-interest. It can be argued that no one knows 
the future in absolute detail, after all. As for the will, the will has no 
mind to decide things by its lone existence as a force. The material of 
animate and inanimate is what contains the force of will; on a related note, 
the will as one single force is dispersed in the way of arbitrary splits 
of economy between all material. The will, being mindless, exists in modalities 
of directionalities, and can be used by the self as a metaphysical propellant 
of a force. But the motivation is very similar, at least, to the deterministic 
qualities of the corresponding self, hence why the simile of the biological 
code of RNA and DNA was used to help describe this force. In common usage, 
when one is said to be "motivated" for something or to do something, by 
the factuality of this text's description, it is the directionality of will 
that has been geared towards that something. However, without the motivation 
that is responsible for the capability, in addition to the physical requirements, 
the possibility of attaining or achieving that something can never actualize. 
Any discussion of metaphysics attempts to define the intangible concept universally 
recognized by any human being as phenomena they feel or think. Due to experience 
belonging to the individual, attempts to define metaphysics always fail to 
reach the specific that can be universally agreed on, but as for a group or a 
couple of human beings, agreement is more easily reached, due to the simple 
reason of less minds for less conflict in specifying definition on the same 
concept. With this acknowledgment in mind of the shortfalls of understanding the 
metaphysical in concrete (ironic, is it not) terms, the conceptualization 
of the hierarchical structure, of metaphysical existence, with self-interest 
being on top of the will on top of motivation is correct by the definition 
provided in this section, and correctness is an unanswered question for 
any detail outside the confines of this section. This here would be an 
example of the shortfalls of Aristotelian logic: to systematize an understanding, 
by use of terms independently defined, does indeed suit the purposes of 
conceptual understanding, but there are specifics of conditions and details 
in practical settings unacknowledged or incomprehensible due to the limits of 
a priori reasoning, so that only the anticipation of a reasonable span of 
possibilities can be correct in moving forward to experiencing the actual. 
So too is any conceptualization of self-interest. There are accurate abstractions 
of self-interest that provide some modicum of understanding. However, the 
details either occurred by chance of coincidence fitting in example for the 
abstract, have not occurred yet so there can only be the prejudice of expectation 
for the particular details to occur, or somehow produce too many possibilities 
to be of any valuable meaning (meaning is singular or at least a unified body 
of sorts, by the way). Self-interest acts in uncountable ways for uncountable 
appearances and effects, and there appears to be no proof, by the default 
of generality, on the theoretical availabilities for an agent to manipulate 
another's self-interest for some other alternative in the spectrum/s of 
uncountable possibilities. 

## More on philosophies of self-interest #40 

The artificial axiom has the weakness of not being in complete alignment 
with the inevitable of the axioms for natural law. From a geometric perspective, 
the artificial axiom rest at least one step on top of the axiom. There can be 
a parallel in the "positioning" of the artificial axiom on top of the axiom, 
for there to be a "synergy" between the constancy of nature and the preference 
of action in the construct of the artificial axiom, albeit this is still an 
attempt to amplify the fundamental, such amplification resulting in not growing 
any fundamental but choosing a form to propagate a misconstrued fundamental. 
In the logic of geometric representation, attempting "positioning" of the 
artificial axiom towards the perpendicular with respect to the axiom is a 
counter against unauthorized occurrence of the axiom. The artificial 
axiom depends on the sentient usage or occurrence of the axiom to exist in material 
or action. The sole appearance of the artificial axiom in use reasons to be 
arbitrary. Why, there are many steps in sentient thought and action in order 
for the artificial axiom to have come about in not only existence but also 
acceptance of it as a rule. For one to understand why the artificial axiom 
is a part of the decision-making by the sentience surrounding them, the 
knowledge of the corresponding circumstances, in temporal spans relative 
to the point/s in time of the artificial axiom's usage, and sentient decisions 
in relation to those corresponding circumstances are pieced together in a 
fashion that attempts to use pure logic. Due to the many steps above 
the axioms of natural law that the artificial axiom presides on, there can 
be multiple, maybe innumerable, causality chains for why the artificial axiom 
came into sentient usage. Even if all causality chains are correct by logical 
construct, the preference for a subset of all of these chains excludes 
certain truths then. But to consider each causality chain as being pertinent 
as rationales for cause-to-effect, there is the potential for there to be 
too many chains for the utility of the rationales to be used in any ways 
other than deterministic or probabilistic preference. This is a mathematical 
description for the prejudice of accepting and rejecting equal rationales, 
logical constructs, to explain the chosen style, form, and nature belonging 
to the artificial axiom. The artificial axiom is arbitrary by judgment 
strictly on the impression of use, the observer's awareness of context being 
incomplete. Through the events transpired in a relevant span of time, in the 
space of the artificial axiom's use, these events having an arbitrariness 
in and of themselves by the perspectives of non-determinism, such that 
the alternative perspective of determinism on these events does not include 
the readily available reason of incontestable standing, the statement that 
the logical constructs used to rationalize the existence and validity of the 
artificial axiom is constantly questionable, in turn, advances the default 
state as an undeniable truth. In complex cases that deal with plurality, there is 
no readily available evidence to support any conjectured cause-to-effect. 
Lack of clarity on the cause of the artificial axiom is due to appearance 
being the first aspect registered by cognition, then the appearance as the 
effect from an ascertained cause that may serve or served the dual purpose 
of an effect from a different cause. Upheld reason for the birth and continuing 
usage of the artificial axiom is that of belief in cases of more than one 
causality chain, or where the validity of any causality chain for explanation 
fails the test of correctness outside of the coincidence for favorable occurrence. 
Belief, of course, is not equivalently the reason of truth. But from the 
cognition of self-interest, the truth is that the self chooses to understand 
and prefers how to understand, with the chance for this understanding to overlap 
with misunderstanding where there is an actual not understood. By frequency of 
the attributes from transpired events, the artificial axiom came into 
existence as rationale from sentience on matters such as the "solution" 
to the "problem", the "help" for the "solution", the "moral utility" of 
the "problem, et cetera. For instance, thievery is a universal vice 
recognized by societies. The label of thievery denotes vice on the 
default of fairness, justice, and equality. To steal something is to 
produce a void of loss to at least one other sentient being. If stealing 
became prevalent, modalities of living that rely on ownership and 
accountability would be threatened. No average sentient being would 
desire to be a victim of theft. So the artificial axiom of prohibiting 
thievery is one that uses the idea of loss in property as unfairness 
by breaking of the rule, the artificial axiom. But the artificial axiom 
cannot be guaranteed to reach a usage more absolute in frequency than 
not, without consideration for the spatiotemporal dependencies. The 
artificial axiom, in social settings, many times works by the moral 
of reciprocity: what one does to another will be returned to that 
one by the another, in kind. The moral of reciprocity makes up half 
of the concept of moral relativism because of its equivalency of one 
action/appearance for another, by the metric of similarity. The other 
half is contradiction and hypocrisy. Despite the relativity in the 
moral of reciprocity, this principle that also acts as an artificial 
axiom for other artificial axioms helps to convolute the original 
chain/s of reason, if any of validity can be found, because it 
depends on social acceptances in practice. The acceptance is what 
counts much more in the social realm of cooperation rather than the 
reason of truth; it can be argued that any reason of truth can only 
happen on phenomena entirely causes from the axioms of natural law, 
but the advancement of sentient will "above" the axiom, capable of 
deciding on choice, must go on. For an artificial axiom to be regarded 
identically as an axiom of natural law, there then must be an 
understanding between two or more sentient beings to act by that 
prescription. Only then can the artificial axiom appear to be one 
of producing effect from the cause without there being discernible, 
perhaps forced or insincere, effort of at least one sentient being's 
will, unreliable, inconsistent in availability. The overlap between 
economics and decision theory also happens to produce questions on how 
the self, how any self, perceives and upholds the artificial axiom 
subjected onto them. Economic thought usually veers towards the 
quantitative in the format of tables that illustrate the gains and 
losses that occur to a decider, the self in this discussion, if they 
were to make a decision in the context of specific conditions such 
as the decisions by other selves. In this focus on the decision 
that actualizes based on the reason of gains and losses, efforts to 
rationalize cause and use by decision revolve around these gains and 
losses, nothing more. Said gains and losses do have reasons for their 
occurrence, by the way. Exclusive consideration of these gains and 
losses to decide means that the reasons for their being do not have 
to be known by the decider. The artificial axiom that takes precedence 
over virtually all others, in economic decision theory quantified, is 
that of leveraging gains for the self and possibly loss for the other, 
in situations of inevitable loss. Many artificial axioms are violated 
in such leveraging, the weighing out of choice a compromise with 
the potential to fulfill self-interest at the loss of consistent 
adherence to these artificial axioms. 

## More on philosophies of self-interest #41 

Self-interest of the self, in the predominant setting of sociality, 
should not be interpreted as independent in cause-and-effect, the 
will to do something possible necessarily meaning that that possibility 
manifests itself, if only because the will is of "the people", in 
the rhetoric of fairness by default. Additionally, the hierarchical 
model written of in this text, self-interest dependent on the will 
dependent on the motivation, does imply that an arbitrary human 
being, no matter how accurate the directionality of their will 
for their want, is required to have the appropriate motivation for them 
to move on to success. Physically, psychologically, genetically; 
the items in this list of three are some main categories in rationales 
on why the will of want does not always manifest the want in the existence 
of the spatiotemporal context. The model raises other questions besides 
from the one on its semantic correctness. Here is one on the model's 
definition of motivation, in practice. Suppose that there is the 
possibility that one human being has the motivation, the innate power, 
to want something, a want that extends outside of self-contained desire, 
but another human being does not have the motivation to. Could it be that 
there is a fundamental difference, possibly concerning that of the physical 
immeasurable, between these two human beings to have motivations for 
different wants? If so, the self's honest conceptualization of their 
identity of wants and self-image can be traced back to motivation as a 
source. Sexual orientation, for instance, is believed by many to be due to 
genetic (innate) factors, the motivation (by the model's definition of its 
hierarchy) instead of the self-interest responsible for expression and 
suppression of sexuality. Shifting focus, the artificial axiom is important 
in analyzing failures to reach the outcomes sought by self-interest. 
Despite the metaphorically great distance between the artificial axiom 
and the axiom in processes of actualization, the artificial axiom does become 
a concern greater in psychological impact to the self of any society 
developed past the basics of providing food, water, shelter. Even these 
basics become subject to artificial axioms of fairness and justice. The 
artificial axiom tames moral ambiguity, gives instruction for virtually 
any sentient decision, given the being's knowledge of the artificial axiom, 
of course, and other benefits to the "social fabric", comprised of the 
"social creature" that all selves, each connected to an individual human 
body, are and the material needed to support their ways of life. The social 
contract, a concept defined some time ago, is essentially a body of artificial 
axioms, argued to grant benefit to the individual self if the self were to 
follow the instructions passed to them through these artificial axioms. 
Human societies, once in great control of their destiny, free from constant 
natural disasters, the predation by carnivorous beasts inclined to 
dominate them if not for their tools forged and evolved over many centuries, 
develop the liberty to not be so narrowly focused on activity so closely 
revolving around the axiom of natural law, although the axiom of natural 
law may be poorly understood and instead accredited to their deities. This 
is not stating that human societies, once developed past a certain point, 
regress to unscientific, unmethodological beasts that only desire an incomplete 
inkling in operational knowledge of the axiom. Instead, the opposite 
can be what takes place. Human societies, having developed some advancements 
for their control over what would have been the fate of their demise or 
other undoings, are driven by the collective interest of self-interest 
to develop new methodologies that use the axiom and explore phenomena to 
exact the unknown of other axioms. However the results turn out, the 
will of want not always coming into fruition, as already stated, the 
availability of the exact knowledge of the axiom is potential untrapped 
for self-interest to continue on in directions dependent on that knowledge, 
that is, scientific discovery and engineering. The artificial axiom 
can be one of decorum, the rule of conduct and the preferred appearance 
as the impression of desirably enacting principle, this being "mannerism". 
An attribute on practices of mannerism, valuable enough to mention, is that 
the effect that is the appearance of the human being, through their action 
and speech, is usually without question on the cause of this effect where 
the mannerist is coincidentally one blindly accepted at face value by 
surrounding sentient beings. The self, being a societal member beholden 
to a social contract of sorts, is predictable at least in their actions, 
but as to their thoughts of desires and deliberation, questions remain. 
The artificial axiom influences the self to be a cooperating agent in 
their surroundings. Morality, etiquette, all turned into decisions made 
by self-interest yet constantly under the influence in some methodological 
way by the artificial axiom. Another aspect that makes the artificial axiom 
so effectively influential on the self, part of a society no longer completely 
and closely revolving around the axiom of natural law, is that the artificial 
axiom is usually the default way of thinking and behaving that they are born 
into. For their own self-interest, downsides great to their relativity 
in standing by the artificial axiom would logically have to occur for them 
to reject the artificial axiom while still a member of that society. Social 
unrest, social movements, social upheaval. These social phenomena are what 
occurs when certain artificial axioms are revolted by many selves. As for 
the self, their subscription to the artificial axiom is purely a question 
for their self-interest. In sociological and cultural terms, this subscription 
is a disproportionate variable in judgments of their civility. 

## More on philosophies of self-interest #42 

Deficits become present in the use of any artificial axiom. The artificial 
axiom is one that inadvertently promotes mimicry by certain sentient beings 
of others in order to demonstrate the corresponding proper practice; but the 
artificial axiom of following as virtue is instead direct. Preferably, 
authentic usage of the artificial axiom, an independent propensity for the 
artificial axiom instead of mimicry, where the positive influence for the 
proper use logically assumes one or more sources of influence can work 
effect by the negative influence, a swaying of the will for self-interest 
to operate towards different ends in matters where conclusive effects as endings 
are necessary, is the ideal. The workings of the economical human being, 
by the lone self and collective, with a tendency to value efficiency over 
the expensive rigor frequently labeled unnecessary and thus stupid, rely 
on mimicry to certain degrees in all forms of thought and labor in the 
social setting. Language is taught from parent and teacher to child, 
prototypes of engineered products are copied and refined towards the 
perfection of an enhanced image derived from an original, and wise sayings 
are passed from one another through word of mouth and/or writing. Understanding 
is not a universal formula of a process. Understanding is reached through 
the spontaneity from the self's cognition of recognizing and expressing the 
principle of an apparent. This is an originalist ideal: if one were truly 
capable in their independence of thought and action, they should be the one 
responsible for achieving the understanding without the guide of hints and 
other supplements. Alternatively, understanding can be reached through efforts 
additional to the successful imitation by one initially ignorant on the matter. 
Imitation of the process is heavily reliant on the rote memorization, the 
experience of the visual to act in appearance for the effect of product material 
or not, in the likeness of the source used for imitation. If self-interest does 
not take a keen interest, a "magnetism", towards the axiomatic construct of the 
imitated process, more comprehensive than that of directly describing the appearance 
of this process, in the independent language of the self for the exactness of the 
actual, then self-interest naturally does not understand the entirety, the cause 
that results in the effects constituting the process they are mimicking. In fact, 
if the influence of the feedback the self receives on their conduct of the process 
is of an importance more than their understanding, the self is not motivated (in 
the categorization of one or the other) by the external, in other words. Their 
motivation, although possessing the potential so that the posssibility is there, 
thereby utilizes the differing capability of metaphorically shutting the door to 
the possibilities of understanding by effort of self-interest, from the will. 
The motive of a sentient being is the primal mark, invisible yet evident through 
exemplifying expression, of their attempted determinism involving themself and 
possibly others. The term "motive", in the context of a deciding someone and an 
action they are supposed to do or an action purportedly linked to them, is a word 
for the "cause" of that someone to do or have done the action. In this text's 
construct that is the dependencies of self-interest, the will, and the motivation, 
in descending order of dependence, self-interest is responsible for the "motive", 
while without the proper motivation for a specific "motive", there would be none, 
so to speak, limited in existence to the realm of will of unattainable desire. The 
"motive", as an aspect of self-interest, encourages the self to strive to succeed 
for the wanted outcomes in relation, and is equivalently the preferred cause of 
choice by a human being. The "motive" is one thing, then, and the actual possibly 
suiting the motive, this reasoning identical to the will being one thing and the 
wanted actualization another, simply because both of these statements draw the hard 
line between the self with their self-interest, their will, their motivation and 
the actual, the phenomena inevitable and the constructs that persist because of 
the axiom's instantiation and the artificial axiom's use that may include instantiation 
of the axiom. The specificities of the context and the context's appropriate 
methodologies for the pertaining problem require solving issues of knowledge and 
adequately fitting execution by that knowledge. Incompetence and willful failure, 
two labels for these requirements. Consider the artificial axiom of "reciprocity". 
The reciprocal, while easy to comprehend in mathematics as the singular process of 
swapping a fraction's numerator and denumerator for one another's position, 
becomes subject to interpretation by the self. Is reciprocity simply mimicking, 
imitating, or mocking as the response that is what is believed to be the 
appropriate action to another existence or action? This would have an easiness 
in positive correlation to the complexity of what is to be reciprocated. 
Reciprocity, as an objective of "equaling" out matters, or perhaps "negating" 
all of a category, in practice would have to be quantified, so that the 
practice of "reciprocating" can be analyzed. Would reciprocation mean anything 
if not for the magnitude quantified, deliberately for a certain mark to send 
a certain message in excess, lack, or equality to the reciprocated reference? 
Or can reciprocating be something else other than the metaphorical "mirror 
reflection"? An appropriate response unlike what was to be responded to. 
Each of these two ways of reciprocating is an artificial axiom, and then 
there is the question of magnitude for every need to reciprocate. A few 
sentences back, the synonyms "mimicking", "imitating", and "mocking" were 
used in the same sentence to lend way to another observation, that on 
natural language of human beings. In terms of efficiency, there is no 
need for any synonym to exist in any language. But language is not entirely 
focused on the efficiency (similarly, neither does the artificial axiom). 
Any word adopted into a language takes on nuanced differences in meaning 
with their synonyms, if there are any. In realms of difference in meaning 
outside of the word's definition, the context by which one synonym is 
used instead of another could have been due to the decision of a play on 
words or a humorous implication on the situation being discussed. Synonyms 
are clear indicators of the practice's plurality by human beings, analogously, 
the variance in attire as the artificial axiom of demand for appropriate clothing, 
the greeting of welcome as the artificial axiom of showing appropriate politeness, 
et cetera. The artificial axiom is but a metaphysical body of meaning, 
requiring the use of a shared natural language between two human beings 
for their conjunctive understanding of similar, ideally identical, bearing. 
It is then to state, with confidence, that the meaning of the artificial axiom 
is essentially an individual's definition, a metaphysical construct directly 
or through influence a product from self-interest. Self-interest modifies 
the official definition, gives "new life" to the word, to the artificial 
axiom as a body of meaning frequently expressed in words, and perceives the 
exemplifying image of the artificial axiom according to the constituents 
of the self's cognition. From context to context, self-interest transforms 
the definition of the artificial axiom, demanded for use, into other forms to 
fit for acceptance; this is how rationalization of the questionable, required 
an answer, works. Transformative processes, from the "fundamental" definition 
of the artificial axiom, for arbitrary usage could demand said definition to 
be altered in order to fit for the form, the "ideal" and whatnot. Artificial 
axioms, as being individuals' definitions, are rules collectivist to some 
particular degrees. The appearance of the collective adhering to the artificial 
axiom, maybe even so much to be interpreted as religious fervor, is deceptive 
to the observer fixated on the "total" before their senses. Self-interest, the 
self, is the unit for constructing the appearance of the collective, maybe 
successfully even fostering a metaphysical (spiritual) unity more unbreakable 
than any material construct. And so, the artificial axiom is instantiated in 
the variable ways of spottiness and totality, with respect to consistency of 
effect from causes identical in principle to that described by the artificial 
axiom, by "social creatures", human beings. 

## More on philosophies of self-interest #43 

The artificial axiom is not always probabilistic in effect. For the clarity 
of distinction between what is inevitable as is, and what can become a consistency 
very much identical to the inevitable by the will for action fitting to the 
effect from the cause specified by the artificial axiom, the artificial axiom 
is identified as "artificial", natural so much as there is consistency in 
the use. The artificial axiom, in its lone existence, is clearly a disconnected 
metaphysical body of meaning. But the artificial axiom in practice, in constructs 
built using many artificial axioms in specific arrangements, how the instantiation 
of one axiom naturally leads way to the instantiation of another axiom in aspects 
such as conditional defense and necessary amplification, becomes ever more 
important in situations where the relevant axioms of natural law are subject 
to the ruling construct comprised of artificial axioms. These particular situations, 
tighty controlled by certain sentient beings, make the appearance and additionally 
the effect very convincing demonstration of the determinism by use of artificial 
axiom. For an axiom of natural law to "be subject to" an artificial axiom, a 
capable life form, technically one or more sentient beings have a virtually entire 
control over the instantiation of the axiom. The corresponding artificial axiom 
for this axiom of natural law consists of statements on the instantiation of the 
axiom. For example, only specific cases of causes specified by the artificial 
axiom can produce the effect of instantiating the axiom. This implies that the 
mechanisms by which to instantiate the artificial axiom are regulated by one or 
more sentient beings, whose rule over the mechanism is via artificial axiom. 
Capably obeying the instruction of the artificial axiom does indeed send 
deterministic impressions to observers, brought into consequence not from the 
indiscriminate axiom, instead from the will of accepting the artificial axiom 
as a rule of behavior to such a degree for there to be no measurable doubt, 
hesitation, or failure to do the part (the effect from the occurred cause) 
on the treatment of the artificial axiom. Artificial axioms manifest themselves 
in many common ways for societies. A person's job salary is fixed within a span 
of values, so that there is no way for them to afford anything exceeding the 
possible span of monetary value, without that person having to obtain money 
from causes not their job. The capability to purchase something, such as a 
service, allows one to improve their material belongings or their physical state 
of existence, such improvements clearly measurable by applying metrics 
of axioms. The necessary sustenance of food for the physical well-being 
of a person, possibly denied to them through the successful implementation 
of the artificial axiom connected to a regulated axiom, under the reign 
of particular sentient beings capable of instantiating the axiom at their 
own command. The notion of control is purely logical with respect to machines 
invented and produced by human beings. The machines can be analyzed to a 
relative completeness in understanding by the physical attributes, thus 
measurable by one or more of the basic five senses or through a device that 
can relay precise measures back to the five senses, predominantly taking 
the form of the sentient being's vision capturing the information of quantity 
and visual. Due to this understanding of the machine made by human beings, 
the machine used that breaks could be logically analyzed according to the 
direction of reversing the construction, the breakdown of the machine 
into relevant constituents interconnected for the functioning of the machine, 
with the interconnections themselves being additional culprits for the machine's 
failure. The human being, capable of logical reasoning appropriate for this 
machine, would have no deterrents in their way of correctly detailing the 
machine's issues, given the condition that the machine's breaking does not 
result in other breakings since this would be a potentially unascertainable 
chain of breaking. But on the matter of the human being accurately relaying the 
machine's issues to others, that is something that can be answered only with 
the knowledge of that human being's self-interest in relation to the machine 
and its issues, such as financial and political motives. Distribution of reasoning 
on the logical, thus arriving at answers unquestionable without deception or 
ignorance at play, to others is at the mercy of the self-interests of those 
with knowledge of that reasoning. But the knowledge of the cause for a machine's 
failure is not always able to be known, and this does spell limits on that of 
reasoning where information is missing or distorted; the causality is not just 
one causality chain but many, or the causality is conceptually a network of 
convoluted, changeable, and unpredictable layout in effects. One can see the 
limitations of reasoning on artificial intelligence programs, if capable of 
decisions past the monitoring in path-like and arithmetic-like patterns by a 
human being. The common automobile, on the other hand, being constructed for the 
predominant purpose of efficient spatial locomotion, with additional amenities 
coming later past the inventions that birthed it, is much simpler to analyze 
for fault: there are less causality chains, less possible outputs from the 
automobile independent from its surroundings changeable through its locomotion. 
The limitation of reasoning about advanced artificial intelligence programs serves 
as an effective analogy for the limitation of understanding the human being's 
internalist mechanisms, intangible and not readily measurable through the outward 
expression of convenience and opportunity. And artificial intelligence programs 
are constructed by human beings well aware of the building blocks for the programs. 
Artificial intelligence programs lack complexities from unknown constituents; 
the scale of their structure and the dependencies of their operation, such as 
large datasets, produce misconceptions in calculative analysis to compensate. 
Misconceptions of human biology, on the other hand, predominantly are due to the 
unknowns, possibly unique to certain individuals. The artificial axiom desired 
to be implemented in ways to guarantee appropriate effect, in light of these 
limitations of reasoning, is done so by sentient beings intent on control in 
the instantiation of related axioms. Consequences, in the nature of undesireable 
effect to violators, take the form of correspondent artificial axioms for the 
particular artificial axioms specified not to be violated. These correspondents 
could be instantiated in forms painful, mentally and/or physically, to 
those that dare ignore the intruction of the artificial axiom. Deprivation and 
incarceration are two designs for the consequential anti-violator artificial 
axiom. By designs such as these, in practice widely enforced, human beings 
of societies that have passing proficiency in control of the axiom's 
occurrence, then find themselves to be regulated by artificial axioms 
and thus mainly obey these instructions as if they were nature itself, 
but to be accurate, this is habit becoming second-nature. The human 
being somehow stabilizes and improves their behavior where will works 
to act for that behavior, and the result is the artificial axiom 
takes on a naturalness much deeper than the appearance, such that the 
will required to actualize the artificial axiom's effect from the 
occurrence of a cause is placed into action by self-interest similar to 
machine work, unquestioning, without consideration for the specifics of 
variables possibly candidates to pose exception. Self-interest works in 
ways not entirely knowable into principles by observation, for there is 
preference and undesireable consequence becoming a duality for the plurality 
in expression by multiple self-interests not in alignment with one another. 
When the appearance, without veil, of many sentient beings is so consistent 
in detail regarding artificial axioms, one would state that the beings are 
in complete agreement on those conditions. 

## More on philosophies of self-interest #44 

Sentient beings, without the artificial axiom, go mad at one another out 
of the individuals' preferences, not judged to be fitting. There is no 
objectivity, no metric to prove the mark of the practice (circularly, the 
proof would be by the metric), albeit the practice may not be subject to 
the mortalities and consequences of the axiom independently invoked without 
a sentient being's intentional action, allowing for dispute to go on, as 
ceaselessly as the material energy and feudal spirit allows. When the 
artificial axiom comes into existence by perceivable representation of 
its metaphysical meaning, there is still chance for disagreement. But the 
basis of such disagreement is different: in the first context, no rule 
exists and the contenders are so to one another so that they can establish 
the rule, and the second context is that of the question of agreement on 
the established rule (the artificial axiom). It is a difference that is 
nuanced in comparison to marked polarity, but its mention stresses the 
importance of the existence of the predominant or the official rule with 
the alternative, that of relative resistance. The artificial axiom, in 
this description's use, has the meaning of a rule greatly accepted, not 
one held by exactly one specific sentient being. Suppose that any sentient 
being can declare an artificial axiom for a specific matter. And these 
artificial axioms, in relation to one another, can not only be on a spectrum 
of pedantic detail to accepting broadness, they can also be greatly contrary 
to one another by structuring decision-making into exactly one or the other. 
A lack of commonality is the defining trait of this specific matter's effects 
from these sentient beings, due to at least one of the two, the differing causes 
and differing effects, between each artificial axiom's statement. Scant use 
of the artificial axiom, correspondingly a scant economy of sentient will 
for this use, makes the artificial axiom a minority rule, perhaps lesser 
than that, an individual's rule. Complication on conclusively generalizing 
an artificial axiom, by the practices that stem from it, is due to another 
aspect, the individual whose actions (the evidence through expression) 
are rationalized only by attributing their actions to artificial 
axioms. And the recognition of a prevailing artificial axiom for a 
group of sentient beings relies on a passing frequency in the accurate 
attribution of the group's particular independent actions, manifested 
as appearance, physical movement, or speech, to the artificial axiom 
(the cause). The artificial axiom as a rule connected to the decision-making 
faculty of an individual, for their self-interest above their profits of finance, 
social influence, or political power in the cases of idealistic individuals, 
has vulnerabilities in its actualization. The poetry that narrates tragedy, 
according to the reason of rhythm, often takes a microscopic interest in 
the specifics of only a few human beings, and translates the actual events 
that occurred into the interpretation for the expression of the sentimentality, 
the universal concepts each and every human being knows and cares about but 
in their own way, the ephemeral existence, the injustices of default and 
throughout that span, amongst other topics. What makes poetry susceptible 
to inaccuracy is not the fiction disjoint from the fact. The directions 
of the messages, the directionality of the basis for the poem as a holistic 
structure, the craft of persuasion at work, and the arrangement of communication 
to elicit sentiment from the consumer are all culprits for this inaccuracy, 
in both interpretation by the consumer and the intended motives for the 
work. On a related note, the fact that is mentioned for an agenda in conflict 
to or reinforcing of a situation is also not without the bias of motive, 
hence there is this note as a justifying reason for one preferring 
fiction or nonfiction, but this point does mislead, through parallelism, 
for advocacy of a completely free consumer market, where the consumer can 
buy anything because of an inherent justification according to the justice 
of fiction or nonfiction being free to prefer. Rewinding focus back to the 
matter of poetics of tragedy, to state that there are artificial axioms at 
play, believed by some, is accurate. Another accuracy, for matters where 
tragedy is achieved not by the loss through inanimate phenomena but by 
the work of one or more sentient beings is responsible for the grimness, is 
that these artificial axioms' use, and additionally their existence, is 
challenged on the premise of a wanted purity in use of these same artificial 
axioms, the practice being wrongful, or due to contrasting artificial axioms. 
If matters of literary tragedy were explained not via the application of 
artificial axiom, then a roughly equal understanding can be achieved by noting 
the whims of certain individuals running contrary to those designated as 
antagonists, by the basis of a goodness assigned to those favored in narration 
but not by narrative fate, and these antagonists characteristic of idiocy, 
lunacy, and conventional sin. But this roughly equal understanding is not 
comprised of the rule, equivalently the principle, of reason, but of judgment 
on what is good or bad and other labeling schematics, thus being at least one 
layer above the description via artificial axiom; there cannot be judgment 
without the experience of perception or a blind choice. Tragedy is one 
category of suffering, and suffering is a topic very widely discussed 
because for the human being, it is a universal concept. Transcendentalism 
is a broad field of thought that has attempted to alleviate suffering 
by sentient beings who, upon finding stability in certain environments 
and labors, become disgruntled with the metaphysical maze of artificial 
axioms, alleged by them to dictate their decisions, restricting their 
freedoms to actualize on objectives of their self-interests. For the 
metaphorical fact though, the "metaphysical maze of artificial axioms" 
does grow a symbiotic binding to the motives of self-interest, how self-interest 
becomes a force not to reach potential or to freely express, on the penalty 
of financial loss or defamation of reputation. And these penalties do not 
even directly invoke the axiom of natural law greater than the immediate 
single consequence of the penalty, instead somewhere along the way after 
facing these penalties, the lucky coincidences from the axiom's occurrence 
are not there, quite the contrary to be honest. The nearness to or a 
possession of a physical resource deprived, perception by the public 
encouraged to take up means through instantiating select axioms for physical 
impact, et cetera. A terse translation of transcendentalism's spirit is that the 
artificial axiom really has no meaning if not accepted, and why should the 
artificial axiom be accepted if its agents only produce pain through meaning, 
if it only encourages unwanted physical violence (yes, this would be 
instantiations of axioms of natural law) or cognitive distress, in which 
the loss in control of decision-making leads to negative effects from 
the axiom? The transcendentalist can also be called a utilitarian that 
has chosen not to be a utility for or to utilize certain artificial axioms, 
on basic premises such as the artificial axioms being deterrents to the 
pursuit of happiness, destroyers of the paradise, when there is the apparently 
better choice of "transcending" the system comprised of artificial axioms, 
run by those uncaring and selfish themselves, to meet the universal ideal 
through personal experience. The concept of liberated freedom, this being 
labeled words such as "autonomy" and "independence", is one component in a 
comprehensive illumination of self-interest, and does speak to the selfishness 
capable by the self. 

## More on philosophies of self-interest #45 

How can the self be thought of in ways that cannot be captured by 
conceiving understanding of the individual, from their self, in formats 
of artificial axioms? There is an undeniable emotive body in any typical 
human being; the straight-faced stoic is not spared from this condition, 
and is praised only for maintaining an air of resolute and tempered 
expression in conditions that would make an emotionalist berserk or 
tearfully insane. The human being, a "social creature", and by this 
label predictable in aspects concerning their sociality and social 
network, such as the spatiotemporal event of interaction and the 
resources possible to be exchanged through the social connection, 
and also a "creature of habit", whose habits of patterns become 
observable and quantitatively measurable in some ways, like 
clockwork, can be understood by artificial axioms defined for 
these traits, and the spatiotemporal matches of the actual with 
the expected, by use of these artificial axioms, serve as confirmation 
tests for the degree of understanding this human being. The famous 
philosopher David Hume, in his Treatise on Human Nature, argues that 
"reason is the slave to the passions". And the thinker did use 
truths convincing in support of this tenet, and in doing so, was one 
that encouraged the conceptualization of the human being as one of 
fundamental unpredictability, for the passions cannot always be 
expressed but kept and guarded like a "spiritual gold" until given 
the opportunity to be expressed as gift to the "one true love". The 
quotes were used for the reason of expressing ambiguity on the 
specifics of passion as expression, and this ambiguity in understanding 
is the great factor for the unpredictability of the other. The human 
being is similar to the numerical span of zero through one, as off-putting 
as quantification of the human being may appear to those adamant 
against quantification of their life, although in contemporary practice, 
a person's net worth and their national identification continue to be 
conventional quantifiers on their existence. In the spatiotemporal sense, 
a human being not at the right time cannot act out of passion, due to 
the reason of one or more artificial axioms said human being chose to 
satisfy. So passion unfulfilled must make a slave out of the reason 
followed, according to Hume, or? Maybe the passion was not of a magnitude 
that passed a threshold. A human being not at the right place cannot 
fulfill the specific objectives borne from their passion. For the time 
and the space, there is a lot of science, many methodologies, to ensure 
that passion has the greatest or lowest possibility of actualizing on 
the specific objective. A human being, like the numerical span of zero 
through one, is subject to birth (one) and death (zero), and in the spatial 
constraints placed on them, the opportunities and wastes that time can 
present, has the capability to think however and to act by their physical 
abilities; the constraints of space and time for a human being's existence 
are another exemplar of the numerical span zero through one. Thinking on a 
past memory, making conjectures on the causes behind some of their experiences, 
imagining an alternative world, and devising a procedure for a quantitative 
problem. The items in this list are much more feasible to accomplish than 
say, somehow changing the course of fate for an entire nation. And despite 
the limits of time and space placed on these possibilities, there are 
innumerable possible courses of thought and action for the human being, 
despite their being so similar to the numerical span of zero through one, a 
span that has an infinite number of numbers that can be reflected onto 
the numerical line of infinite length by proportional mapping, the reflection 
having a passing appearance for the infinite cannot ever be reached, and 
also despite how little difference in outward impact or influence these 
innumerable possibilities may result in. The shared quality of having infinite 
numbers between the numerical range of length one and any range of any length 
besides one, towards infinity, allows opportunity for some societal 
happenings. For example, the human being is not one that exists by great scale, 
but through great image and the appropriate standing, can cause changes in mind 
and action of many humans, these changes so great as to be viewed quantitatively 
as astronomical, infinite-like. The passion of the human being, likewise, can 
be regarded as infinite by their self and maybe others, yet constrained 
by spatiotemporality, thus worthy of the metaphor, the numerical span zero 
through one. Passion perhaps cannot be regulatable, and this is demonstrated in 
matters of genuine love from an individual, out of their self-interest that 
is not entirely for their independent self, for a subject of study, a person, 
an entire group of people. A couple implications of Hume's tenet, mentioned, are 
that passion is a factor in the want and the work by adherence to a reason 
being at harmony with one another, and passion allows one to forfeit the 
fear of unwanted consequences, many of which would be due to their fellow human being's 
need to satisfy specific artificial axioms, these the reasons, at the loss of 
the passionate, to look ahead to focus entirely on satisfying the passion 
through incident and/or dedicated practice. The passion unsatisfied in favor 
for the reason is passion that does not necessarily die. And the lack of 
an axiom of natural law for passion to die if unsatisfied does pose 
issues to consistency in satisfying a reason. Passion could somehow 
manifest itself, even after the deprivation, the deception, and exaggeratingly 
all the pains the world has to offer, could it not? Passion is somehow 
connected to self-interest, in the scope of idealism first, but if the 
practice of the passion is the skill most admirable of the individual, 
then the passion in practice is pragmatic, if and only if the relevant 
artificial axioms practiced by one or more sentient beings do not present 
much interference costly in their resources renewable or not. As for the 
objectives the self wants to succeed in, due to passion, and fails, 
there is still passion, and the objective replaced for another or 
nullified because of the failure being the one solution unreached. 
The follies found in love and marriage, as statistics not entirely 
captured for the record, offer terrific discussion to proceed about 
passion in the face of failure, after the sad fact of failure. 
Here is a situation on gender roles and questions on the male. 
There is a man and a woman. The woman, in her belief that it is 
the man's responsibility to approach and connect with her, in other 
words, of the orthodoxy of feminine passivity and masculine 
aggression, is not forward in her desire for him. She believes it 
is his responsibility, while she is supposed to take a role natural 
according to her mannerism, like a statue representative of heavenly 
beauty. The man, as a "social creature" that desires her, considers 
his identity, perhaps due to his classism of career and socio-economics, 
maybe because of an identity that is minority in comparison with the woman, 
is also not forward in his want and does not approach the woman in the 
manner that signifies a love proportional to that from his passion. 
The two ends never meet. Cowardice from the man, via fear of the 
consequences, one in actuality more desiring of the position of 
socially fit than any love, might as well be a lie, that did not 
actualize for the woman? The woman, too stupid, conceited to sense 
the love, an admirer of her own self-image, that of an inanimate 
statue, therefore a narcissist? Going back to the man, would his 
decision to have taken the opportunity to cause both ends to meet 
make him some kind of "brute", a shame to his "people", an "outcast" 
to his "society"? And to end discussion on this man and woman with 
details that could very well be for a dark comedy or a light-hearted 
laugh on the futilities of life, the man marries someone "of his kind" 
to fulfill an ethno-cultural mannerism, the woman likewise, and both 
become so terribly unhappy about what love and marriage is from their 
experience. Passion is a personal matter for self-interest to act on. 
Temptation, fixation on the purpose, and obsessions of the most 
unhealthy kind are how passion drives the self. Self-interest is 
a container if not a utilizer of passion, and the self being one 
that can process feeling as reason of personal truth, also as reason 
for, must take care to treat passion as a double-edged sword, constantly 
remade by a different swordsmith at every chance opportunity that calls 
for its expression, not subject to control of quality so that risk of 
breakage or being turned against is posed. This here is where the 
mention of the concept of "self-control" is important for the pragmatics 
of self-interest economical in decision-making. Lastly, practicing of 
passion can be partly understood by use of the categorization of 
impulse (pseudo-controllable) and deliberate habit.

The reason for this writing's use of the term "artificial axiom", instead 
of rule (political system, social order), is because of an awareness of 
the connotations. The "rule" and the "artificial axiom" are similar, but 
the rule as a legal tenet for a political system, the ruling of a political 
system, and the rule to promote social bonds would send messages to the 
reader different in resonance from the ideas expressed using the concept of 
the "artificial axiom", as well as the explanation on this concept by way of 
definition of the core and projecting forms. The artificial axiom is a design, 
of mathematical connotation. The design is fluid, inspired by a creativity, yet 
operates for virtually the same conceptual product. Furthermore, any design is 
done so for the sake of specific construction. Constructionist thinking is 
encouraged by the phrase, "artificial axiom". The rule is static to satisfy the 
political ego, for the business tied to the economics of power instituted through 
governmental and enterprising operation on an axis of stability; this is the objective 
of the rule. The rule is to bring order to human beings, the "social creatures" 
that they are. Through the rule effective in and of itself, and also persisting 
through changes, improvements and reforms to rule may be made. There is the "human 
factor" in the rule. Invoking the rule brings to mind social interactions such 
as at least one and their utility of the rule, and at least one to others responsible 
for upholding the rule. The artificial axiom, with its mathematical connotation, 
is a tool of rationalism, and although reason fails, there is the attempt for 
the rationale greatly preferred over the control by rule. Systematization 
in comprehending any phenomena, or of implementation into system for phenomena 
is by axiomatic understanding, comprised of axioms. Recall that this text's 
usage of the term "axiom", redefined for this text's purposes, is to denote 
the axiom of natural law, not for any arbitrary rule, guideline, or consequence 
for violation, especially by the sentient being, very especially by the 
sentient being from a cynical perspective on humankind. This is an attribute 
that is important enough to note again. However, since the title of this 
text is Self-Interest, and due to the lack of self-containment that is 
self-interest, detailed in both expression and the internalist mechanisms 
responsible for forces such as passion and the will, forces that tend to 
exhibit a magnetization for that which is external to the container, the 
human body, everything written so far in this text is not solely on the 
artificial axiom. A focus entirely on the artificial axiom would mean 
nothing more than a complete and thorough definition of the concept. 
Instead, this writing sought and continue to seeks the artificial axiom 
as attribution in what branches out of self-interest, oh but if only 
self-interest were a simple plant seed to grow into a tree, incapable of 
locomotion, then the writing would be on botany.

The artificial axiom cannot be thought of as an autocorrecting tool. 
Autocorrection is an example of automation, and to say that a sentient 
being, in the context of other sentient beings, can be automated is 
dehumanizing. And just because dehumanization exists, in scale marked 
enough for the phenomena to have a word for it in English, does not 
result in the sentient being having the quality of being automated. 
The sentient being can work in patterns efficient, like clockwork to 
appear automated, but they are not, proven by the occurrences of 
their contemplation and change-of-heart. The two points used as 
proof of the sentient being not being automated constitute a stance 
strong in the bias for humanity. Artificial intelligence can "contemplate", 
that is, re-learn for differing ideas and tenets to reach different 
conclusions based on the same material data. Artificial intelligence 
can also have a "change-of-heart" through updates that change the 
constitutional making of the program or hardware swaps. This is 
insulting to the uncapturable essence (their will) of the human being, 
of course. Their contemplation spurred by callings from their moral 
compass should not be equivalent to re-learning done by artificial 
intelligence. The human being loves one another, according to what 
many say; the argument that the human being is fundamentally good is 
a frequent argument. Artificial intelligence, on the other hand, operates 
by electricity, the inanimate material, and the computer code. Quantities, 
materials. The steadfast humanist of orthodoxy is sure to ask: "how 
can these things ever reach the innermost essence of my life, my 
spirit?" The sentient being is better thought of as one of habit, 
capable of more habits and of removal from habit. The appearance of 
their efficiency for tasks of pattern and creativity are the habits 
with the innate capability. The will of total does not belong to 
any one or any thing, and the idea of a noun as being automatic 
in quality likens the noun to a tool. It is because of wanting 
control over their self and furthermore, over the understanding of 
their self-interest, that the human being desires for their will 
being for their own. "Autonomy" is the term denoting the ideal of 
choice for the human being of independence, and their being made 
"automatic" in thought and action forfeits an autonomy for other 
opportunity, at least in the theory, but for the practice, unanticipated 
coincidence by chance is very much something; some people even claim 
the idea of luck as a nontheistic religion. After this point made on 
sentience being non-automatic, there is still the matter of "correction" 
to argue for the artificial axiom not being capable of auto-correction. 
The artificial axiom originates from self-interest. There is nothing 
innately wrong with self-interest. But every artificial axiom is susceptible 
to being ignored on condition. Every artificial axiom, before instances 
attributed to it, can be split into at least two alternatives: of 
accepting or rejecting the envisioned practice of it. 
Both of these traits of the artificial axiom give leeway to the notion 
of "right" and "wrong", and this notion does not require the need of 
mentioning morality. The preference for the course of action, from the 
"right", is supposed to be better than what is from the "wrong". This 
preference, of course, is on the premise of knowing the lone and 
immediate context for which the artificial axiom is to be used. The 
artificial axiom is not for sentient beings' autocorrection, noted 
in this next statement. Some desire the consequences for others, 
when the cause can be wrongly identified. The effects from an 
arbitrarily selected artificial axiom is what the some desire. 
The cause did not have to occur. Or the cause did not have to 
occur by the means mentioned that would have made the instantiation 
of the cause be viewed as wrong. Some deceive for the ends, and 
remain specifically principled nevertheless, and this cannot be 
autocorrected. The statement, "human beings are principled beings", 
maximalizes the idea of the innate goodness of human beings into 
their outward activities: the human being's outward expression, 
from a kernel of goodness, can be and should be according to 
principles in alignment with that goodness. The principle, 
contemplated on when it is appropriate to act on it, without 
question, is a principle forsaken by a human being, out of an 
interaction between their self-interest, not of the uni-directionality 
to not question out of a recognized uncertainty, and their will. 
And the term "principle" is found across fields ranging from 
mathematics to ethics. The "principle" is a part of the kernel 
that is the innermost essence of operation into forms, varying 
in appearance but having a shared commonality by the "principle". 
Having a knowledge of the principle allows explanation for the 
forms from that principle; this reasoning suffices for more complex 
cases of multiple principles definitely responsible for the form. 
The "principle" explains the structure of what is. One notion, 
in the category of correspondence theory, is the human being that 
is bound to a right principle must not forsake the principle, 
lest they also forsake their ethical composition, that from the 
kernel of goodness. This, in turn, leads to some predictability 
of a human being that belongs to a social order, bound by that 
principle. This specific human being has an aversion to deliberating 
on the principle, and acts in line for the principle, such that the 
principle is the true metaphorical light at the end of the tunnel, 
not the gains, promised possibly with an underlying deception, 
obtained by acting in contradiction to the principle. The preferred 
usage of "artificial axiom", in this text, over that of "principle" 
is due to the liberalities ascribed to the "artificial axiom", by 
the written definition and reasoning on and with it. To clarify by noting 
a contrasting quality, the "principle" from certain perspectives is 
something that is firmly rooted in its respective field/s; through 
trial-and-error, the "principle" has matured from its conception into 
something acceptable on the one hand, also something that cannot be so 
easily challenged on the other. When the statement, "human beings are 
principled beings", is supposed to be taken as the truth, there is the 
expression still to be made. For example, ponder on how economies of 
great scale in production are, in aspects closer to their source/s than 
to their products. The factory does not require a human being to think 
on matters unrelated to their immediate spatiotemporal surroundings 
and the factory's regulatory guidelines for their employees. Time is 
critical, so sacrifices in independent thinking have to be made. 
This is an artificial axiom for some human beings, and recognized 
by other human beings as a principle after their interpreting of the 
statement as something firmly rooted for the correctness of achieving 
the objective, greater production. How should the human being, one that 
finds it in themself to be a worker for greater production and have 
obedience that signifies loyalty to their organization, think about 
themself if they perceived their self as an automatic agent? Surveying 
of opinion would yield answers on this question. To issue a statement 
as a principle to follow on this question, however, is sure to promote 
questions on what dehumanization is when there are preferences in 
competition with each other, namely the human being's willingness to 
submit their arbitrary potential for the forms that push them towards 
at least acting, if not also thinking, like an automatic agent, such 
that their impulses have been detached from their self and re-engineered 
back into their self for the automatic action and additionally for 
the automatic thought, versus the local scale of individual 
independence. This is a classic example for the question on what 
the definitive traits of humanity are, when there are practices such 
as these officially documented ever since the Second Industrial 
Revolution. The matter of scale cannot fully enable individual 
divergence to be the representative cause. The unwilling individual has to 
value their differing self-interest more. Not only that, but the unwilling 
individual has to break free from all of those artificial axioms placed 
onto them, to "transcend" the system that they may so despise. The 
unwilling individual must manifest a growth in their doubt of the humility 
typically ascribed to taking part in the shared cause of being one with the 
masses and one for the mass cause of production or ideology, and to devalue 
those causes that made them faceless and ruined their time for lofty thoughts. 
Uniformity over the personal expression. Recitation instead of original 
and forthright interpretation. These are a couple ways in which self-interest 
clearly works as a force for the striving of the human to be an automatic 
agent. 

## More on philosophies of self-interest #48 

Self-interest is an operationally incomplete force. The feedback loop of 
oscillation between satisfaction, through matching achievement, and 
dissatisfaction, through not matching for an unmet achievement, is a source 
of great suffering, according to many paradigms of thought, such as those 
of Eastern religiosity and the Western scientific model of dopamine on 
human biology. Attempts to not fall prey to this loop of suffering rely 
on the full execution of methodologies, those with the objectives of detachment 
and a derivation from what-was to what-can-be, in turn establishing new 
satisfying equilibriums that lessen the effects of volatility from oscillating 
between needy dichotomies. Resignation, resolution, acceptance of what-is and 
what-was, for equilibrium. When the force of self-interest is comprehended as 
something intricately connected to the outward expression, in this sense, there 
is demand and thus the drive to actualize for accomplishing satisfactory ends 
for that demand. Self-interest, through expression from the as-is of being, 
that is, the self, is constantly confronted. These confrontations take forms 
such as the reflection by the cognitive self of their expression; the self 
metaphorically hears their own echoes, and every echo caused by them is 
comprehended by them with chance for their re-evaluations. Another form of 
confrontation consists of those in social contexts, phrased differently, 
under the rule of the combinatrics of implicit and explicit commandment in spheres 
of influence. But there are no dynamics of dichotomy required to be a part 
of the self. An unwavering faith, for instance, of the self is somehow not 
compromised by their expression, through their self-interest, into the outward 
context subject to partitioning of favor and multi-labeled feedback. There is 
a need to continue life for whatever purpose, according to the self's understanding 
of their self-interest. The self, through their experiential existence in 
differences such as the dualities of strength with weakness and satisfaction 
with suffering, arrives at the conclusion that there are dichotomies possibly 
detrimental to them; this conclusion would be dismissed for their intents and 
purposes if not for their self-interest's acceptance of the validity behind 
separatist representations of what-is and what-was. The phenomena that involves 
the interaction between the internalist mechanisms of the self and their external 
implies that self-interest is not a self-contained force, even when the self has 
a natural-like repulsion to their outward expression. Some particular categories 
of sentient practices, due to self-interest, exemplify economical mindfulness. 
During the time of Colonial India, for example, there are anecdotes that stated 
the British were cold, distanced, and humorless to likewise unfunny Indians 
(however, the author of this writing recalls these anecdotes from memory and 
cannot find the specific source to cite, as of the time of this writing). The 
archetype of the British as being witty and entertaining was not found in these 
anecdotes, and this archetype is from that of their media. The British 
in Colonial India were not professional entertainers. Their roles were 
predominantly soldier, diplomat, and businessman. Every single one of 
these roles require appropriate acts in behavior, fitting for the context. 
Out of the many accomplishments from India, humor and comedy are not at 
the top of their list. This statement is one of perspective. The Britons 
had to "mirror" Indians of Colonial India, to certain extents. Britons 
in Colonial India are one example of economical human beings. Instead 
of expressing from the basis of their national origin, synergy for 
equilibriums connected to cooperation was done for the self-interests. 
This analysis is not without the fault of surreptitiously downplaying the 
context that Britons of Colonial India were in. Obviously, they were in 
another region of the world, predominated in numbers by natives there, and 
for them to act as if they were back in Britain would make them out of 
touch with their surroundings. Promiscuity offers another example of 
economical mindfulness. Promiscuous women are appealing enough for 
"chasing" to only particular types of men. And some of the other men do 
have attraction for them, but due to having to stand in the metaphorical line 
in order to "get some", these men instead refuse and reassert their rejection. 
Besides from the minimizing of individuation from having to stand in line, 
there are also systems of alliances at work. Married men are inarguably somewhat 
subject to their significant other. Men from different backgrounds use the 
commonality of a shared attraction to specific women as points of contention 
for feudal grounds. The self and their self-interest restrain and temper lust, 
what is not thoroughly irrational cognition in and of itself, but because of 
their surroundings such that they must act according to their role in the 
economy, so that their self-interest believes that they themself at least 
is an economical being, something that can be considered moral by appeal to 
pragmatics, not necessarily the purity of thought for action. Moving on to 
contexts greater in the number of human beings, each with their self-interest, 
an arbitrary supply chain, by the locational design, has the probability of being 
prone due to the dreaded "sprawl" of distance from one corner of the globe to 
another. The production, protected in one region and in another either incapable 
of or prohibited from, becomes concentrated in one corner. Transportion from one 
corner to another, possibly for continual construction of the incomplete 
product, to a final destination is a spatial logistics issue, through to this 
day due to the need for maximalizing on efficiency by way of what-is. Some 
nations then become prosperous, as individual human beings, and service-oriented 
in their collective economy. And despite the weaknesses of the "sprawl", a 
move that in the physical context favors denial, specifically to those not a 
part of the variably-shaped and elongated connected body of sprawl, instead 
of a concentrated power that is more exclusive to those outside of the centrality, 
the "sprawl" enables capabilities agnostic to the spatial context to thrive because 
of the linked benefits from the operating supply chain. And in many cases, the 
concentrated source, a statist nation for instance, despite its executive 
efficiency, is not able to gain any more than it loses when it attempts to enter 
competition by breaking into the other's "sprawl". Here is a pseudo-profound saying 
on this: what is strong exclusively at the center cannot be strong outside of the 
center. Self-interest, a force from the self, has objectives that may extend from 
those relatively smaller demands that persist life in the host. There are objectives 
born from what can be phrased as needs for the extraordinary, recognition of the 
greater path, et cetera. The recognition by self-interest of one objective being 
more valuable than another displaces an equilibrium that was for the other objective, 
but now, the self must somehow satisfy their self-interest by envisioning another 
equilibrium, or alternatively a step towards some arbitrary equilibrium, for the renewed 
objective.

Next is a continuation on the operational incompleteness of self-interest. 
The best that the self can ever do to satisfy a satisfying equilibrium, 
and this satisfying equilibrium may be unknown to them before the "right" 
time, is minimizing the demands from self-interest's attribute of in-itself. 
A relinquish from the untameable passions. A confidence for the self to 
exist according to their "purpose of living". The dependency of self-interest 
on the will on the motivation, complete synchronization, alignment, and 
integration for something fully realized by the self as whole. This is 
what the full satisfaction of the in-itself attribute is, with respect to 
self-interest. Self-interest, something not self-contained, faces difficulty 
along with its self in unsuitable spatiotemporal environments. The concept 
of expression is the raw material for the key, unformed until activity by 
the human being into outward forms perceivable by others. The phrasemes 
as-is and what-is, denoted by such common words, are fascinating because 
they are large in the breadth of communicable meaning on them. As-is is the 
understanding through knowledge that is information gathered from perceiving 
the object, in conjunction with the output from the decision to accept background 
information, from previous time spans and with details cognitively weighted 
in relevance for that understanding. The understanding from what-is contains 
the as-is, due to all information details considered and the conceptualization, 
that which includes perception and judgment, on the object's "self", will, and 
motivation; the understanding of what-is cannot be complete on what-is. Mutual 
understanding between two selves is of the as-is, but there can be a certainty 
in belief that the as-is is, for their intents and purposes, the what-is. The 
what-is of an object has the quality of being a malleable stabilizing factor 
for an other's understanding of the object. This is especially evident when the 
object is truthfully a sentient being. Mutual understanding between two sentient beings, 
each demanded to express due to the lack of self-containment from their self-interest, 
is subjected to the malleability from the hierarchical dynamics between 
the forces of self-interest, the will, and the motivation, thus alters because 
of these derivational dynamics. A stranger intent on remaining a stranger to 
another prefers to be exclusively understood in a category of the as-is; this 
category is understanding through the dominating influence of direct observation.
Ideally for the stranger, the direct observation is the as-is. The direct 
observation entirely corresponds to the observer's perception and judgment of 
them. When the as-is changes into differing form and more differing forms, 
the observer, without comprehension of the what-is, accepts their understanding 
of the as-is as the what-is to bolster their confidence of belief in their 
own understanding. And understanding can include misunderstanding, even 
though self-interest is not self-contained, when the content of the understanding 
is not wholly expressed for corrective feedback. Understanding of a matter believed 
to not be able to be wholly expressed for the what-is, the result being varied 
expressions specifically done so to be different to one another due to attempts to 
satisfy the whole of what-is, is repetitively circular and non-conclusive. The 
objective, in contrast, can be devised with any degree of understanding, and 
neither the process of devising or the product from this process have to be 
expressed. Self-interest cognitively processes a objective, but without the 
underlying motivation, the objective cannot originate from the self. Due to 
this simple reason, many have actually focused specifically on another's 
objectives, comprehending the other's means taken in the process for each 
objective as something intentional in that other's belief, in their own 
beliefs that they can effectively comprehend how the individual matters, 
right down to their innermost essence, their will. The human being's 
objective most pertinent to another may be non-disclosed. However, the 
analysis by the other can be by constructive inductions, possibly into a 
final hypothesis that terminates the inductive process, on how the human 
being's actions are intended for their wanted result, the objective most 
pertinent. In atypical instances however, the objective becomes very peculiar 
to express, even if there is an acceptance of the human being's motivation, 
a dependency for their will and self-interest, that is regarded as understanding. 
One category of cases include lips quivering, due to an upset to the human being 
that they cannot contain but should, for their objective explicitly noted 
by their self-interest. Another is psychotic twitching and jerking, phenomena 
that affects the physical and the momentary feeling of a human being experiencing 
it, and they may be so accepting of the experience that they do not recognize their 
movements as symptomatic of their issues connected to their motivation. The 
human being can invent problems if they do not already tend to their present 
problems. This phrasing presupposes that problems can be invented. A problem 
is what comes out of recognizing the understanding of the as-is to be 
something that is supposed to be counteracted to minimize the recognized 
errors in the qualities of the as-is, from the understanding. If problems 
can exist, in the thought of belief or through recognition by perception 
(a judgment), due to the instantiating of axioms of natural law being the 
single requirement for the problems to be causes, then anything thought or perceived 
can be considered a problem; in matters of utility, the problem gets translated 
into economical division, and also incorporated into the workings of the economy. 
The usage of participles for the term "invent" was deliberate to display 
invention as a synonym for cause, and cause can actualize out of a belief in 
a fallacy. This is a viewpoint held by some human beings, untrue although the 
viewpoint is an effective artificial axiom for ends out of motive. 

## More on philosophies of self-interest #50 

Proportionality, a paradigm for understanding any object, by uses of meta-structures 
composed of values denoting relations between grouped elements of pairs or greater, 
is a basis of rationalization for aspects such as aesthetics (beauty, resonance, 
properness, et cetera) and objective solution (balance, efficiency, satisfying of 
threshold requirements, integratable, usefulness, et cetera). The numerical span 
zero through one, although containing infinity numbers, cannot be reflected onto 
a numerical span of length infinity, by the proportionality of evenly-weighted 
subspans of the numerical span zero through one. This fact was stated in section 45, 
although its phrasing enabled cases to be made that contradict it. For example, 
travelling from zero to one, for the last number X less than one in this travel 
reached, the span X through one can correspond to the span that is the correspondent 
of X (for the infinitely-lengthed span) through infinity. This case is not a 
proportionality based on evenly-weighted subspans. It is not a proportionality 
that can be fully grasped. To elaborate, the numbers in the span X through one 
cannot be assigned as individuals to the correspondent subspan of the 
infinitely-lengthed span. The only as-is understanding for the connection from one 
subspan to another is to be understood is by this subcategory of as-is: from-oneself. 
In this writing, from-oneself has the definition of understanding through knowledge 
that is information gathered from perceiving the object as an integrated and irreducible 
representation. This case has the subcase of no travel from zero to one, so that a single 
and direct connection of equivocation is drawn between the two spans. For each 
number from the numerical span zero through one demanded a correspondent, an 
arbitrary number, not yet been assigned, in the infinitely-lengthed span is assigned 
to it. And not all of the assignments can be comprehended from a what-is criteria, 
even if infinite were reachable. For this specific subcase, there are no centralities 
found in the span zero (excluded) to one (excluded) to serve as markers; a centrality 
would be the start or ending value of a subspan. Needless to say, the task of assigning 
an infinite number of numbers to another infinite number of numbers, into pairs with one 
from each, results in outputs very much like art, given no additional information on the 
one making the assignments, for this would lead to a kind of predictability on the output. 
Representations, by use of primitives such as numbers, can satisfy certain demands of 
individuals and are deemed flawed usually because their translation from one medium to 
another bears effects thought to be adverse. The number is lifeless, and so is the word, 
because the innermost essence of these two tools is the result of stripping out all the 
expression, as well as the sentient knowledge of it, and also the structures that 
represent them. What is left is something that is not meaningful to any life. The number 
and the word are tools, with their forms of expression originating with the intent to 
translate meaning. And meaning is a centrality, but for the sentient being faced with 
a problem that has meaning outside of a numerical span, meaning is not as simple as 
the examples of centralities found in the beginning of this section. For the sentient 
being, there is meaning to be found or made, and meaning, in cognition, can also be 
believed or rejected. Association, through the connections between two elements, 
possibly of non-identical categories, produces a meaning on top of the meanings 
of origin. Reasoning, through processing of the available information's surface-level, 
by means of derivation for additional forms and construction of connections, is a 
practice intended to satisfy logical criteria, at least on the surface. Through 
the drawing of connections such as by metaphor, analogy, or network, an understanding, 
not guaranteed to yield preferred outcomes let alone be full and accurate in-itself, 
can be used for practical purposes of projecting effects of choice-precision from one 
distinct body to another. For example, a context for practical use of the understanding 
is conducive to bearing expectations from actions that affect the context via the 
effecting application onto a known fundamental of the context; this statement, in-itself, 
is indeed not about the pragmatics, but the barebones general of applying understanding 
for a wanted causality. Human beings have done things out of something that can be 
called unquestionably intentional (but this is not an argument for determinism), by 
the application of their devised or learned methodologies, out of some reason, that 
are perplexing to process, if processing is constrained to the as-is, from-oneself, 
or an fallible understanding of the what-is. Protectionism for the merchant, heavily 
involved in international trade, limits their trade and shrinks their profits of 
official currency, thus giving cause to the effect of their reaction to this kind 
of security that they were never even asked to consent to; this sounds political and 
financial. When an entity socially engineers the perception of another as to effect 
a social pressure onto them, who then unintentionally fosters their own vulnerabilities 
for their downfall; tragedy and the ruthlessness of human competition are common 
descriptors for this. When an organization or person circumvents the rules and/or 
boundaries, and is able to derail people's whims, additionally to dash these 
people's hopes and dreams; this makes for an example of how political craft and 
uncomprehensive legislation result in something unresolved by an impartial and 
complete reasoning. Someone is keen to act by the statistics that they know, 
since the statistics are the starting material to form probability distributions, 
in order to decide by the relational metric of what is best, and is surpised to 
realize that they were deceived when their expectations were not met, such realization 
fostering a kind of madness in them, due to their belief in the reasoning that is 
a non-transparency in information, possibly their exclusion from the norm, hence 
they failed; irony, psychological thriller, corruption are some choice words. 
When political movements are characterized by phrases such as factional republicanism 
and democratized statism, strong messages are sent. All of these examples are not 
confined to the number, but perhaps all of them can be accounted for by the recording 
of their actual events, so that reasoning about them can proceed forward. The 
iteration of the methodology is cold if action is cold, and the established 
methodology to be followed is cold because it is instruction not open to 
consideration in any other way. The human being can be taught the methodology. 
The human being can even be intelligent enough to devise the methodology, or 
to derive the embedded methodology from accounting of the experience. What is 
really left for the human being to think and do once they have achieved the 
understanding of the methodology that concerns the events? Retention of the 
knowledge of the methodology into human memory or material. Application of 
the methodology. Do these two statements, in this context at large, not read 
as something incomplete, perhaps required of an inquisition to shed light on? 
With sentient beings, especially those required to be integrated into social 
contexts, of sorts, there have been and will be some things that just cannot 
seem to be accomplished, despite the intention after the mastery of the 
methodology. There is God, then. Human affliction, however can anything 
outside of the facts be stated with such air of belief, but to not say 
anything else besides the facts known? Human affliction can be attributed 
to tests by God, in order to deny recognition to the afflictors as the 
sole force of the perceived wrongs made and at play. Maybe the situation of 
the human being is there because of reasons they can comprehend, alongside 
existences that they cannot ever grasp the innermost essence of. And the human 
being, in their attempts to detach from unwanted situations such as those they 
believe to be insufferable or chaotic, for their desired result to be a 
third-party observer not forced to participate in something that can only 
encourage their wrongdoing, find that they cannot. To take solace in their 
situation, they believe in God. God is good, yet others say. Christianity, 
in particular, as a monotheistic religion revolving in great part around 
the word transcribed into the Bible, has characteristics different to 
non-theistic religions and even counterparts such as Islam. In relation 
to the category of non-theistic religions, Christianity has a much more 
established written doctrine due to the reliance on the one representative 
text, the Bible. The Bible, through the events it describes, offers believers 
the material for their moral compasses. Figures such as the mortal giant 
Goliath and the sea monster Leviathan deliver meaning to believers on the 
monstrosities at play. In contemporary times, Goliath has been a metaphor 
for particular organizations that are much too great in scale that they 
have been forced into roles imposing on anyone or anything else. The 
Leviathan gives believers a sense of some great and wretched unknown 
that they must face, from time and again, such that the encounters 
may result in their end of life. The purported literal inaccuracies of 
Christianity bear evidence to anyone, not just the believer, of how meaning 
is delivered to them past their own life experiences. The primitive of 
the practices that are so emphasized in non-theistic religions, perhaps 
even theistic sects (this includes believers of Christianity), are the 
expression of the low-level doctrine that unites their respective followers. 
And the expression results in more questions than answers in the initial 
occurrences. Past the initial occurrences, the opposite can become true. 
The extremities in effects from actions are illustrated in Christianity, 
by the Biblical plots. The book of Christianity has much more developed 
details than the base, the foundation, of any human understanding, and 
thus delivers to believers strong messages on their mortality, by 
exemplification, and also messages that they can, in fact, play coordinated 
roles en masse to become monstrosities on par with the Leviathan, by human 
perception, thus "doing the Devil's work", from a moral standpoint that 
delivers meaning developed on top of the notion of good or bad, so prone 
to the relativity of inversion and in the literary context, irony and 
questionable justice. One of the major distinguishing traits of Christianity, 
as practiced, is its expression that runs contrary to doctrine such as 
the Islamic prohibition of depicting Allah. This Islamic prohibition 
encourages an appreciation against definitional representation, in 
certain aspects. What becomes murky to develop rational conclusions 
on is how this affects aspects such as technology development, as well 
as ways of thinking and acting, since all else is not equal by specific 
quality. Both faiths started off as being regional, but Europe came to 
subscribe itself to Christianity, while Arabia came to adopt Islam. The 
geography of people is one that is cultural and expressive of the culture. 
Faith is oftentimes interwoven into the societal makings of the geographic 
region, and in some cases, the nuances are what delivers. Buddhism, despite 
its lack of an official deity, is inclined to the practice, the methodologies 
per se. This misleads some people to believe that this mentality is naturally 
conducive towards scientific thinking, but in fact, subjectivity fosters, 
arguably natural, in part because of practices spanning across vast territories. 
There is a reason why many separate religion and science in discussion, although 
there is reconciliability in any two distinct matters, by simply connecting 
them into an oneness acceptable. Organizations consisting of human beings are 
fascinating, especially when one is forced to consider them in lights not 
entirely confined to religion. For example, a Catholic populist, after stating 
that he has relinquished his ethno-national prejudice, becomes a priest to 
proselytize his faith to those peoples that, by his standard, never had the 
privilege to be civilized. In his appearance and approach with foreign 
peoples, fostering their belief in God from his communication to them, 
of an intertwining of his interpretation of the Bible with his agenda from 
continental and national leaders, Catholic followers grow in numbers. 
What tended to happen was business and politics likewise became a thing. Habits also 
became a thing. A Catholic convert in one non-European land had a fifty-fifty 
chance of also being a populist, by the default of no additional knowledge 
on the context. And a Catholic convert that is a populist could not entirely 
be a populist all because of their newfound faith. There were certain periods 
in time where Catholic priests, having arrived in foreign lands, were not 
well-received by the natives, since by the perspective of the natives, the 
priests were connected to foreign militaries that planned invasion into native 
land once the natives "opened the door" to the faith represented by the 
Catholic priests. Another commonly held view is that religious conversion, 
alone, is insufficient for any meaningful gain, for those that push for 
a common language, with undertones of inclusivity, to build and share 
connections over a stretch of space, inadvertently encourage local despots, 
due to the possibility of governance decentralized relative to the shared 
faith. In the historical context, when the Mongol Empire became firmly 
established after defeating the Chinese governments, then the lands of 
Christians had scientists develop superior weaponry to them, the Mongols with 
their long track record of successes, the Mongols that were ever-incorporating, 
the archetype wild ones with nature and thus the rightful controllers of 
fate by their being the sole representative of nature. This chained statement 
is not complete or entirely accurate in the retelling of what happened. It 
serves to illustrate how human language, especially, is able to transform itself 
into expressing the archetypal expectations and dichotomies, intertwined with 
ideological bodies of thought, as well as the political mores concerning intellect 
and material. In retellings of historical tragedies, there is one on how tens 
of indentured servants were decapitated for forming a resistance against 
Christian opposition, while a slave in another hemisphere was a comfortable 
secondary person. In matters of unfairness, a Christian priestess says "please" 
anytime she wants something, and gets it, all because she is a devout religious 
representative. The human being can be something else outside of their internal 
thought, could they not? Man can be a critic, as woman can be a liar. Despite 
some matters that did indeed occur and yet others that were greatly dramatized, 
with objectives to denounce certain faiths, there cannot be retellings that are 
all complete and nonfiction. Human beings, in quests to "transcend" what they 
can or do know, have used religion in ways much more broad and comprehensive 
than standalone scientific tools. For one to view themself as nothing more 
than a means to an ends would be self-denying if they have a desire to be 
more complete than their functions. Human beings also are inclined, in some 
contexts, to interpret their existences in ways that are not fully controlled 
by social constraints or ruled by constructs of politicized ranks. 

## More on philosophies of self-interest #51 

The intellectual is an interesting member of human societies. Some human societies 
take the additional step of demarcating the intellectual into a distinct social 
class, on arguments entirely justifiable if the environment of such demarcation, 
any social demarcation in fact, is self-contained; a will that has its way is a 
will that does not "cave in" or "fragment". Intellectuals are curious agents with 
respect to the demands of the economy, and the term "economy" is used for more than 
one single territory. The adversarial forces against intellectuals is of utmost 
importance in understanding some unifying principles around intellectualism. 
Anti-intellectualism occurs after the recognizing of intellectuals as members of a 
distinct class. Intellectuals are then presented as members that are experientially 
removed from society at large. Education systems, being the primary institution for the 
intellectual to grow their knowledge base and refine their intellect, train the 
intellectual to adopt certain values unattainable by many, to think in certain ways 
of specifics suitable to the success of their interests, by coincidence possibly 
their wanted occupation, therefore their forsaking of the fundamental does not allow 
them to relate in whole to the commoner, one with problems of foundational magnitude 
for the commoner constitutes the base. By this accounting, the intellectual has to be 
somewhat removed from the commoner. The commoner, as their title suggests, does common 
things for a living. The commoner is not known for thinking anything other than common 
thoughts. The commoner predominantly buys common things. In any nation, there are 
industrial sectors. A basic economic model posits that there are three sectors, similar 
to how there are three primary colors that can produce any other color. The primary 
sector and the secondary sector, being those responsible for activities concerning 
raw materials and production from those raw materials, respectively, are not the 
industries predominated by intellectual objective. The primary and secondary sectors, 
comprised of workers, can be more accurately thought of as physically-heavy labor venues. 
The tertiary sector is pertinent to intellectuals, but because many occupations form 
this specific sector, the sector does not revolve around the pursuits of the intellectual. 
Politicians, militarists, artisans, scientists, teachers. The list goes on. In a classist 
perspective, how would the intellectual thrive if not for whom they stand on, as the saying 
goes, "on the shoulders of giants"? The intellectual would have to allocate time to labor 
in the fields to produce crops, in slaughterhouses for meat, and in factories to assemble 
machines and manmade foods. Intellectuals, being ones keen on development of their intellect, 
something that cannot be repossessed for others by the criteria of self-attribution, find 
materialism to pose issues, although this does not indicate much on their uniqueness since 
every human being persists only because of certain material demands met. Intellectuals become 
ascetics as protest against the striving for excess in material for their living, and thus 
intersect their practices with many religions that denounce the worship of the material. 
And for that, the intellectual becomes useless to commercial growth, for they feel disgusted 
with the designs of man that tend to be sold by the numbers of currency coins, after being 
branded luxury names, although they may appreciate the designs on a from-oneself basis, in 
other words, there is merit to the products out of quality that outshines and overpowers 
what is the norm, synonymously but not exactly, the baseline for living. The intellectual 
that solidifies their thinking into idealist notions, then becomes an agent that outweighs 
the positive occurrences labeled as those notions over others. The result is the 
intellectual rejects some particular notions that go against their views, and the 
intellectual also has to tend to internal forces of discouragement on learning about 
other ways of thinking and acting; the other end of the extreme, however, is really not 
any better on the premise of imagining an intellectual as a monkey-esque agent that has 
no morals or unique styles particular to their existence, instead every human activity 
that has ever taken place and every human thought expressed becomes subject to their 
fascination so much that they take the additional step to take up these variants as 
part of their outward expression, in order to demonstrate their fascination. Intellectuals 
that are not challenged, on the basis of their views, will naturally have no imposing 
external sources of motivation onto them. They become self-justifying, and if the 
primary and secondary sectors continue producing products affordable to their way of 
living, the intellectual need not bother, out of biological necessity at least, to give 
these sectors any second thought. The intellectual, given the freedom to think and produce 
material in regards to their thinking as part of cultural change, finds that without 
the material world to correct them on possibly fallacious thinking, without having to 
see for themself the sufferings wrought upon those that labor, is truthfully given not 
the freedom to actively rule. The intellectual, out of their desperation to transcribe their 
ideas onto material form in order to play the part of an intellectual authority, but 
without being required to have competent and working knowledge on the axioms of natural law, 
may tend to perversely fondle with their head to output ideas of a questionable quality, 
by default of no additional knowledge outside of this sentence. It is true that the 
political and the intellectual are not one and the same, needless to say, since the 
two labels are represented by two different words, different in definitional meaning. 
So it is wrong to assume that a politician, by default, will favor intellectual discourse 
when they are democratic, or favor intellectual practice when they are republican, 
when in fact, the politician has the role of societal representation, that which may 
include hard power that they can wield. No saying is so concise, in an attempt to prove 
this, as "the pen is mightier than the sword". The politician metaphorically stands on 
top of both people and industry, and so must look to the people and their work structured 
into industries, in order to make policies in accordance with these qualities gathered 
from political oversight and transmitted to them. Intellect is a quality that forms a 
crucial part of the self. The uniting aspect behind all biological intellect is the 
quality of self-awareness. A human being is unique, at least according to human perspective, 
in the sense that they are a "social creature" whose cooperation with and antagonism against 
others rest on artificial axioms, decision-making metastructures. A human being, if gifted 
with an intellect at birth, primed for certain outlets, has the opportunity to be many roles 
that rest on top of this gift of theirs, although there is question on if these opportunities 
are really due to intellect or to something else, perhaps their results from start to 
accumulation influenced in great part by the interconnected workings of artificial axioms. 
It is human intellect, from the organ that is the human brain, that allows human beings to be 
the planet's pre-eminent manipulators of space and governors of time. And the statement really 
only has the question of what "governing of time" is, as just cause, for debate. Similarly, 
in various cultures across the world, the heart is viewed as the organ of love, happiness, 
and anger (the expressive sentiments), while the stomach is viewed as a container for 
hatred, sadness, and fear (the hidden sentiments). However true this may be, the mention of 
human organs, stratified into distinct or predominating roles, is for the purpose of discussing 
how the rational human being, considerate of the roles of political power and financial leverage, 
sees another in their conceptualization of the whole, such as a machine that should not 
malfunction or a cultural dance that should not be interrupted by outsiders. Intellectuals 
become property owners, and their possessions do offer them bases to acquire additional power. 
For the aristocrat, the meaning of this observation has always been a heavy matter for 
consideration. The intellectual that somehow acquires wealth and political power becomes a 
capable contender to the aristocrat. History teaches the aristocrat to put in place incentives 
to prevent accidental relinquish of political power to the intellectual. The traditionalist 
aristocrat almost always follows this artificial axiom, and will justify this by presenting 
the intellectual as someone that values trial-and-error over orthodoxy, a costly liability 
then. Another common justification is the intellectual's life experience is removed from that 
of an oversight or military role, so the book is all they know. And the book is merely one 
step above genuine discourse, and genuine discourse one step above gossip. There is a hard line 
separating the intellectual from the general populace, the aristocrat argues for their 
incompetence. But with no additional information given, the question of an arbitrary intellectual 
being populist or fringe persists after such a hard line. Artificial axioms devised to 
implement and thrive a stable society, as people in fixed roles of power and privilege, passed 
down from one to another in exclusive terms such as familial heritage, poses the idealism of 
merit as the values greatest when continued through bloodlines. So it is most certainly not 
always the aristocrat, in society, that cripples the intellectual out of some historically-based 
fear. Just as the individual has their self-interest, their society, appearing and acting 
under such things as a national flag or a religious symbol, always has interests declared 
as one. For example, if a politically-motivated force were to decapitate the intellectual 
class of a specific region, seldom do the reasons stated not mention political threats from 
that class. The exclusion of certain members from society speaks to that society's 
relational posture amongst neighboring peers, as well as how members of that society 
opine their views and push their products; this can be rephrased in economic terms, but 
doing so would emphasize the labor and material more, when in many cases, the material 
and labor were already there and what was lacking was will for appreciating the spirit 
of thought. Meritocratic procedures are a complicated subject when implemented to cover 
the various ways that human beings exhibit intellect and physical skill. Suppose that 
one individual, because of their intellect, was able to pass an entrance exam into an 
research institution. Another individual is able to excel in business and marketing. 
In the second case, it can be reasonably argued that the individual may have come to 
excel through intentional improvements after their specific experiences. And in the 
first case, the individual was able to do so by some combination of factors, such as 
access to learning resources and possibly genetic predisposition. Matters that cannot 
be entirely and objectively measured, such as running speed and maximum weight of 
lifting, are complicated by the plurality of viable paths, viable because there is 
probable gain for the individual to travel down. Objective testing of intellectual 
aptitude, usually by standardized testing, has been and continues to be put into question. 
The standard, comprised of rules for scoring and templates for questions, can be learned 
by a competitive person beforehand. Through the rigor that person dedicates their time 
to, their testing score will increase, at least up to a certain point. So the human 
being may have some thresholds to their capabilities, by the metric. However, the human 
being is not one required to be bound to a metric for every pursuit or activity per span 
of time. Historically and up till now, a human being governed by the metric is one that 
is governed by another human being's devices. The most noble aspect of the metric, established 
as an outcome of empirical studies, is that it defines human capability by percentile. 
Unfortunately, these percentiles are human-relational, and one human being 
that scores higher than another has the reason to feel a positive sentiment out of 
the sole logic of better performance in comparison, so the metric cannot be initially 
considered anything more than a performance mark for the specific tasks measured. Through 
the projected ramifications of a specific performance mark, the mark changes in 
interpretation. Initially, the as-is is identical to the from-oneself. Then the as-is 
in understanding is expanded, as much as human predictive capability allows, for the 
objective of equaling the what-is of the mark. The metric, in hierarchical use, can 
only organize the whole by percentile range into equals, and each segment, of equals, 
is designated objectives that require more than that metric. Peers that are equal by 
the metric are either both accepted or rejected, if selection is really based on the 
metric, and this truth sets the stage for unstandard happenings such as disintegrative 
plurality and dichotomy by competition. And the notion of "luck", as a qualitative 
judgment of an individual's life, is quite interconnected to the social construct as 
well as spatiotemporal settings of occurrences. Now imagine if intellect were dedicated 
towards survivalist and domination strategies. "Luck" would be involved. Merit would 
be involved. And socio-economic status would be involved. Out of all the various ways 
authority by royalty or by bureaucracy works, there seems to always be room to 
question. By the actual events and possible plots concerning this statement, human 
beings hear and read about all kinds of tales of peculiar individuals, such as those 
that obsess to see another's head on a silver platter, those that conspire against 
their "own people", and those that become so apathetic to achievement, out of 
their belief in the possibility of their intellect being used against their 
self-interests. What a self-interested individual, that is, one that is committed 
to the ultimate aims associated with their self-interest, does one day, out of 
principle, cannot be expected to act by that same principle for the same problem 
on another day, due not especially to their mortality since death is only once for the 
individual and their self, but to the coincidences and intentions that constitute differences 
as scant as nuanced as inputs, but for the outputs, not so much.

Why would the human being, out of their self-interest, complicate matters when 
such complication is not only because of "food for thought", or for "food for 
thought"? Consider this line of reasoning, such that the words "economical" and 
"moral" can be swapped for one another, due to perspective on the "best" ideal 
for decision-making. Economical decisions are not all moral decisions, all moral 
decisions are economical decisions, and all ideals are economical decisions in 
practice. The statement can be considered obtuse, and perhaps even encourages 
cruelty, in the forms of prejudice, for upholding the economical assignment, 
and hate, in upending the economical assignment, due to sentiments of unfathomable 
and unfavorable inequality. The economical perspective places man as finite in 
body, and more importantly, in the spirit of mind for decision-making. Man, out 
of pragmatism, places utmost importance on the economics, in his practice of 
actualizing, yet says, even believes, that he is one for the universal, one of 
ideals by default of his being, forced to concede out of his misfortune of 
being born a mortal puny, by the ideals forged through his greed. Man and woman 
are virtually identical in this aspect, and the reason why the term "man" was 
used instead of "woman" is that man, like the sperm, is not stationary (the 
egg), and so must reach outwards to project those things that can never be quite 
contrary to his aspiration for power. This is, of course, an archaic viewpoint, 
especially when one considers the fact that violent and large-scale warfare, 
as well as sexual intercourse, these activities most representative of man as 
the sperm, are not the pre-dominant activities of male human beings, however 
much the two categories of activities may constitute their objective psyche in 
specifics, and in the broadness that aspires to the universal, their ideals. 
The economical perspective stresses the human being to be a remorseless pragmatist, 
for their concerns are predominantly extrinsic and their rationale for abiding 
by certain artificial axioms, such as institutional prejudice, are due to 
information presented to them in empirical format, from sources ranging from 
the authority that commands them to they, themself from their thinking critical 
by the basis of economics, a field in which participants can never be the whole, 
from start to finish, and can only win the "whole", in such cases clearly imbalanced 
for all, although fairness may be another question. The moral perspective of the 
statement, at the center of this discussion thus far, is one based on the thoughts 
and feelings of the human being. Such thinking and feeling can, on rare occasion, 
produce truths that are axioms of natural law, or artificial axioms much superior 
than others in harnessing one or more axioms of natural law. However, the strength 
of the moral perspective does not rest on the material, and many times the perspective 
ignores the ends and downplays the beginnings, in however the permutatorial 
choice. The moral perspective expresses the universal, and when confronted to 
provide proof, argues by utilizing that which is intrinsic to each and every human 
being, despite their background, appearance, capability, and status, posing these 
qualities of the intrinsic as the ideals, so argues for these ideals to be the 
objectives, devoid of inconvenient happenings and orders belonging to the spatiotemporal 
context. The moral perspective can be as cold as pure logic, since the initiatives 
from the moral perspective have been and continue to be presented as something 
objectively measurable, such as the frequency distribution of gross domestic product 
per household. Human societies, of governmental law and order, are stabilized by the 
enactment of artificial axioms; these conditions allow for the respectively relevant 
norms to be known, eventually, by every member of the human society. Human behavior, 
as the explicit effects from artificial axioms, is predictable partly due to the factor of 
societal consensus on the divisions, including but not limited to that of "good" and 
"bad", of "beautiful" and "ugly", of "smart" and "stupid", and of "worthy" and "useless". 
One major ramification comes out of human societies' stabilization being reliant on 
obeying artificial axioms. There are less questions demanded to be asked about the fundamental, 
what with the prosperity that human societies can attain because they have a stable base 
of operation predominantly of their own design, out of self-interest, not subject 
in entirety to the indiscriminate wrath and luck of occurrences from the axioms of natural 
law. When the idea of prosperity is questioned, and certain events are labeled "injustice", 
the moral perspective supercedes that of the economical perspective, in judgments of as-is 
(the first impression for understanding). The moral perspective relies on the passions 
for denunciation to be delivered, and the forces of passions seek the probability to win 
against the imperfect logic of the economical perspective. In historical terms, virtually 
all major revolutions, especially those spurred by industrial and/or ideological leanings, 
are due to the moral perspective, for the economical perspective in these settings usually 
serve conservative interests, meaning that not only do the leaders are to remain because of 
their righteousness, but also the initiative to change involves disassembling the as-is 
and re-defining the what-is, in simple mathematical terms, taking three efforts instead 
of one to move forward, a hassle and an impractical expense then. The division of 
perspective into two categories, the broad and overlapping "moral" and "economical", 
is expected to be met with unappreciation, a disgust for the inaccuracy of terminology. 
What is "moral" and what is "economical", many will say should be one and the same. 
Common arguments include that the artificial axioms born out of economic reasoning are for 
the moral way, and the adverse consequences because of these artificial axioms are 
their misuse, not their fundamental flaws, although the artificial axiom is 
at least one step above the fundamental of the axiom of natural law. Gestault. Wholism. 
Both Westerners and Easterners have formulated fields dedicated to constructing and 
preserving the oneness of the matters that surround them.

The adversarial human being has a great demand for control of complication, 
similar to how biological ailments, driven by agents of disease and death, 
complicate the musculoskeletal and/or immune systems in ways non-localized, 
perhaps unrecognizable to diagnosis by medical specialists. Adversarial 
social environments are ripe with the machinations of human beings, systematic 
in truth yet unable to be wholly proven as entirely deliberate, so much that 
the machination could be called an orchestration, creative and spontaneous and 
lyrical, expressions from the passions of purported unpredictability. A naive 
mind, being a witness to the events conducted by humankind, their half-hearted 
labors for an extra coin, their majestic words to drown out the sorrows of 
disappointments and outrage of the populace, and tales of individual human 
existences near and far, cannot understand in full, due to having insufficient 
background knowledge and unsharpened cognitive tools. And yet, the naive mind's 
lack of experience is what prolongs their impartiality. The words from the 
naive mind are an accurate transmission of that mind's memories, regarding 
their perception, and views. The naive are fair because they are not beholden 
to externally-based motives, and also lack awareness on the specificities of 
the consequence corresponding to each relevant action. The naive are not as 
functionally able only because they are not habitually developed, unaware of 
views adversarial to their specific existences, and lacking in knowledge that 
enables their judgment of the future based on their perception. But these 
three reasons are, in fact, important distinguishers between the ignorant 
and the learned, the unskilled and skilled, the representative and the 
commoner, amongst other dualities. Also important to note is the fact that 
the ignorant can become capable, while the learned can resort to wickedness 
through the implementations out of their attained knowledge. Likewise, the 
unskilled could know the fundamentals for why the skilled are such, and only 
because of the division of labor are the skilled designated roles typically 
more prestigious than the unskilled. Distinguishers are for the cause to
recognize instances of a noun by one or more adjectives, out of the probable 
labels. Consider the probability that a distinguisher fails to maintain 
relevance; the distinguisher, serving an artificial axiom agreed upon by the 
powers governing society, ceases to produce arrangements comparable to those of 
the past, encouraging self-interest to decide on bases heavily leaned 
towards the passions of motivation, with regard to the logic of the artificial 
axiom that is not of the present, a historical relic, even a universal vice by 
principle, a backwardness that was uncalled for and thus rightfully discarded 
from being one of the prevailing artificial axioms. Complications, out of 
the force of self-interest found within all human beings, yet more influentially 
pronounced in some more than others, then effect rule inconsistent with static norms. 
The demands of individuals drive them to ignore particular artificial axioms, in 
their path to meet their demands. And without the will to place barriers, 
invisible for the purpose of maintaining an openness conducive to certain forms of 
transmission, most frequently for finance and all those ensuing laws with the 
capital, these individuals do fulfill their demands, much to the chagrin 
of the proponents for the artificial axioms meant to both deter those individuals 
and exclusively benefit them, the proponents, through the specifics of that openness. 
Oftentimes in societies of lenient governance, it is private enterprise that 
haunts the individual, with aims to break that individual's objectives out of their 
self-interest, because the individual does not heed to the prescription of the 
artificial axiom; the question of who benefits from such prescription to the artificial 
axiom remains, but by the default selfishness a part of self-interest, the benefactor 
is assumed to be the private enterprise, in other words, a rival entity to the individual. 
The artificial axioms provide the cause for human beings to be principled, yet human 
beings are not mechanistically programmed to adhere to them. Any human being, out of 
self-interest, is a private agent. This is their default categorization, an individual 
with physical traits possible to be known, and underlying psyche possible to be approximated 
into general descriptions containing their inclinations and motives, and this allows 
a predictability on their fulfilling their objectives. Transformation, phenomena that 
can take forms such as the physical change of a caterpillar to a butterfly, or one person's 
words into their motive, is change that, if relevant, is typically accounted for in some 
way, such as being guarded against if viewed adversarial by the self-interest of some human 
beings. For example, even in nations that consider themselves structured wholly by merit, 
these nations do have artificial axioms in place to guard against unwanted social mobility. 
The concept of meritocracy is enacted by the practice of correspondence theory. An 
individual excels in something, and this is proven by their performance marks. The 
individual gets somewhere, such as being promoted to a position in a bureaucracy. There, 
in the bureaucracy, the individual works for the bureaucratic initiatives. The bureaucracy 
accepts the individual into its ranks, in great part because the individual has merit 
by the marks pertinent to judgment of their worthiness. In turn, this same bureaucracy 
becomes choicefully hostile to other individuals that may excel in areas, perhaps better than that 
individual, at their peak, and this division could prove to be a great source of 
rivalry, contained during prosperity and peace, and unleashed when collective direction 
is lost such that priorities involving notions such as supremacy must be re-instated 
through ending proof of competition. Meritocracies can prove fatalistic, can they not? 
Things get set into place, the procedures and the people, and then the wheel is spun by 
the effort from the will. Then the wheel terminates by the inevitability of the axiom 
of natural law. Artificial axioms cannot be entirely followed by every human being, 
without there also being protocols that rely on instantiation of axioms of natural law. 
A human being may find an artificial axiom foolish to heed, and denounces it in 
so proud and outward of a fashion that another human being, a proponent of that same artificial 
axiom, interprets their decision as cause for antagonism. A cause for correction. A role 
to play. The artificial axiom, when implemented effectively enough to become institutionalized, 
would be foolhardy to debate, if peace is to be preserved. Cultural institutions, in particular, 
magnetize the individuals of their vicinity, in ways so that norms and expectations are set, by 
implication that is the ramification from the tenets of the cultural institution. Effective 
cultural institutions can exert effectiveness in rule equivalent to that of national law, and these 
occurrences prove the multi-expressive trait of artificial axiom manifestation. An artificial axiom, 
as a device effective in the socio-economic context, must account for the principle of individuation. 
Out of one thing, such as a concept, there can be many cases, and these cases are unique 
enough to be different,along many measures, to one another. But the cases are all attributed to 
that one thing, and by logic, none of the cases would exist as they do without being from that 
one concept. When some human beings arrive at the conclusion that an artificial axiom no 
longer serves its individuation, specifically those human beings' preferences for a specific 
matter, then the artificial axiom becomes more of a principle of exceptions. A principle of 
exceptions does not contain the individuation. Such principles can break in expression, out 
of their enabling spontaneous alternatives in certain matters, to let other artificial axioms take 
precedence in decision-making. The term opponents use for those that operate by a 
principle of exceptions is "hypocrisy". It has already been stated in this text that 
the artificial axiom is not an autocorrecting tool. This discussion serves to illustrate 
some more on that statement; the artificial axiom could be a principle of exceptions 
never leading to any meaningful consensus. So besides from the fact that the artificial 
axiom is not something that is, for the sentient being, will-less, the sentient being 
cannot have their actions constantly justified by the artificial axiom.

"Loyalty" and "honor" are words describing two ideals, overlapping in 
characteristics with each other, that help in humankind's understanding of 
human beings in contexts of consideration. Unlike the specificities that 
agents of governmental law attempt to produce, via rules specific enough to 
the nature and the magnitude of specific matters, "loyalty" and "honor" are 
concepts that are practiced in a variety of ways, based on the spatiotemporal 
specifics and the sphere of influence. Just as how governmental law proves 
time and again to be insufficient in addressing injustice, via the delicate 
balance between meritocratic institutions and "equal rights", so much that 
the government is expected to cater to crime and drug lords in some regions 
of the world, and corporate lords in other regions, out of their insufficiency 
compared to the greater grasp of control through power of wealth and terror 
that the lords can deliver, the concepts of "loyalty" and "honor" can only 
serve as the backbones to the multi-faceted ways of understanding and acting. 
This is ironic since the development of the good, by governmental law, into 
specifics can be only out of the reason to account for the specific circumstances,
by reference strictly to the fundamental notion of good; however complete the specifics 
of the law may be, human beings can circumvent the specifics by use of their economical 
decisions, or pitting one violator against another violator. And the concepts of "loyalty" 
and "honor" are susceptible to being open to interpretation by those that see the 
concepts as all-encompassing labels, and without institutionalized constructs 
to structure the lives of human beings into outlets and behaviorial patterns, 
the concepts are as good as material gold without an owner, something human 
beings can fight for in their striving to attain the status, since by the achievement 
of the status, circularly, the means of competition used to reach that achievement 
and the means of rule enabled by that achievement are supposed to be justified 
solely by that achievement. This reasoning is a big category in the antibody that 
disapproves of the notion of merit being as infallible as omnipotence. In it, 
there is the idea that competition itself is supposed to be the domineering 
determinant in what is "right" or "wrong", which then subordinates the system for 
righteousness, that which is supposed to hover over all of human beings, to simply 
becoming a tool for particular human beings. The frequent retelling is on the 
circularity of wrongdoing, viewed in ways such as the most deplorable yet preventable 
tragedies, and comedies depicting the foolish and wicked as very entertaining forces, 
out of irrationality, that is, their thinking and actions do not fit the 
conceptualization of good in the form of linear chains of reasoning. The circularity 
of wrongdoing is frequently told in a factual kind of way, with undertones signifying 
an apathy on the premise of helplessness for the inevitable wickedness of human 
beings, in their oscillating movements of attempting to correct actions by 
other actions, and then to narrate on these actions using labels of "good" and 
"bad", typically by the basis of their being the good. "Loyalty" and "honor", 
ideals universally recognized by human beings, require bases to support the 
qualities of the populace, so that the practice of these ideals cannot be 
immediately subject to rejection by the weakness of enabling relativity, when 
in such cases, relativity enables unpredictable re-defining of the societal 
norms, of representatives and attitudes. In real life, human beings have loyalties 
that center around the family structure and their individual identities of ethnic/
national/ religious affilation. These loyalties do not go away so easily, especially 
in areas where an individual's livelihood is tied to forms of institutionalized 
servitude. A human being that remains loyal may, in fact, be dishonorable for 
supporting what has turned ghastly wrong. And another human being can be honorable 
by not remaining loyal to what has become a hindrance, a force corrupting to their 
independence. A human being with unquestioning loyalty is one whose honor is 
exclusively associated, in all aspects, to that loyalty. A prejudiced honor is a 
betrayal to the universal understanding of honor, but the "social creature", the 
"political animal" that is the human being is one that has as much difficulty in 
ruling their locality as in understanding the universal; as such, the typical 
human being cannot be expected to be honorable without external cause, or to be 
loyal when there are better options, and this is not only because of selfishness. 
When one betrays to break a loyalty, another human being is the recipient of the 
betrayal. And when one betrays to break an honor, they betray the goodness of 
their conscience and stain their ideals. Honor is, therefore, superior to loyalty 
in preserving moral integrity. On matters of restriction, the honorable are 
restricted to acting by a set of principles. In other words, the psyche of the 
honorable is governed by artificial axioms that are fixtures to their modus 
operandi. The loyal, on the other hand, do not act for the metaphysical artificial 
axioms that are impartial to any human being, although are nevertheless predictable 
by their restriction to serving their associates and superiors. Loyalty is personal, 
from one human being to another. Both "loyalty" and "honor" are part of human activity 
for the purpose of combatting unwanted change. Loyalty, being a personal attachment, 
favors the familiar and the incumbents. And honor judges the magnitude and quality 
of what is present with that of the past. As such, the honorable are superior to the 
loyal in improvement by innovation and fighting corruption. Merchants constitute a 
comprehensive class of human beings, in the sense that they are constantly balancing 
"loyalty" with "honor". Merchants are traders, and rightfully, there are reservations 
about activities of trading, for traitors are traitors because they trade values of 
material and information against their professed loyalties. The greatest privilege 
bestowed upon the trader is that since they are demanded to interact with other human 
beings for exchange of material, they oftentimes have to metaphorically break down 
barriers for demanded products to circulate. Traders are less psychologically resigned 
to principles, with aims concerning two major categories of objectives: capital profit 
and human connections. The competent trader is a master of relativity, from having to 
re-adjust their prices and interact with different peoples. Through this mastery of the 
relative, the big trader is a ruler of trade, reinforced by the loyalties of others for 
them. The trader that grows successful is also one of reputed honor, in some aspects, 
such as maintenance of agreements when faced with adversarial commercial conditions. 
Merchants are interesting, as case studies, because their loyalties are not immediately 
known, and their honor is very much tied to human connections and profit. Whereas the 
bureaucrat may be just as immoral as the merchant, the bureaucrat is fixed in place, 
having to be an agent for their bureaucracy. The honor that the bureaucrat claims to have 
had before their entrance into the bureaucracy may be genuine in spirit, but becomes 
operationally institutionalized in practice. In the national context, the cases of 
Vietnam and Japan have a lot to offer for discussion on "loyalty" and "honor". 
The Japanese military honor code, Bushido, is inarguably greater for discipline and 
industry than that of the Vietnamese. Historically, the region of Vietnam has a 
very internalist spirit. Their close proximity to other southeast Asian nations and 
to the subcontinent China keeps them well preoccupied when they are not busy bickering 
amongst themselves. The Japanese are protectionists moreso than internalists. And 
this is proven by their early adoption of firearms technology, namely the arquebus. 
The Japanese have a cultural appreciation for quality, from their iconic swords to 
other technologies that at first mimicked that of their Western European associates, then 
surpassed them in many ways. The feudal period of Vietnam never produced any Oda 
Nobunaga. The fighting was quite focused on the authority over the land, and 
when the French began colonization, the spirit of intellect by the Vietnamese was 
that revolving around political ideology, of their conceptualizations of the republic, 
the state, democracy, and communism, as if their collective soul was sucked into the 
null void, forcing them to rediscover themselves again. Comparison of these two nations' 
development over the past thousand years, of course, cannot be reduced to the concepts 
of "loyalty" and "honor". Besides from geography playing a pivotal factor, the mores 
of the two nations, based around conceptualizations of honor that placed importance 
on excellence and of loyalty that often turned racist, drove them along very 
different trajectories, demonstrated by their scientific and industrial prowesses 
historically till now.

The socio-economic constructs that human beings are responsible for, in their 
co-existences, cannot possibly be strictly meritocratic without resistance. 
Objective judgments of merit require consensus on the metrical criteria. How 
that criteria is devised is not innately required to be transparent. In the 
computational sense, the rigidity of the metrical criteria, due to observance 
of frequent forms and preferred styles, is not encouraging of alternative 
means to produce what is to be judged. Due to this attribute of the metrical 
criteria, the recognition of merit in artistic works exemplifies the concept 
of cultural relativism, that is, the metrical criteria is based on the cultural 
correspondence of certain qualities to the gradient of zero (non-ideal) to one 
(ideal). The practice of conformity is also an effect from the cause to satisfy 
or revere the metrical criteria. A human being, acting by their self-interest, 
first judges their own capabilities and their potential, and will conform to 
some extent. The metrical criteria is an artificial axiom for a human being's 
judgment of merit, and pre-eminent ones help to shape human beings' reception 
of the facts, despite their possible rejection of these artificial axioms. When 
open information is considered to be the fair form of knowledge in the setting 
of judgment, and fairness is demanded, the metrical criteria of scores for the 
judged is wholly presented to them, as objective proof of the method. In cases 
such as these, the metrical criteria helps industrialize human beings towards 
respecting if not satisfying the mark. Through the motives and objectives that 
self-interest operates for, the metrical criteria established could be quite 
impossible for a majority to satisfy. This is especially true for matters of 
aesthetics, in which judgment is focused not on the nature of function through 
time, this being functional merit. Because judgment of aesthetics is focused on 
the combinatorial interaction between the recognized norm of appearance and 
preferred extraordinaries, naturally, there are only artificial axioms, 
nothing close to the axiom of natural law, to ascribe the ideal. However, 
perception to yield quantifiable information on the traits of the object 
can be accurate, but this is not the same as the label of "aesthetic". 
Matters predominantly deemed subjective do not have any associated metrical 
criteria of strong consensus; in the various fields of human activity, 
there are a few broad categories for these matters, such as the independent 
arts and politics, where the force of self-interest argues for their truth 
of relative to be that of the objective. It is because of the strong subjectivity 
a default attribute of the arts and politics, where expression and rule can 
produce acceptable results in various ways, that human beings, over the 
progress of time, have accumulated artificial axioms of decorum and operation, 
garnering social acceptability and lessening potential chaos, that become 
second-nature to their approach for these activities. In turn, traditions 
are retained on how politics is supposed to work and the kinds of artistic 
expression that can never be of the orthodox to certain regions. Artificial 
axioms of tradition are so reinforced in some areas that many human beings 
no longer feel the need to mention the fact that these artificial axioms are second nature, 
in their lines of work and the roles they must uphold. The implementation 
of meritocratic procedures, especially those on performance, have the 
greatest potential to effect difference by change. Self-interest cannot 
possibly accept defeat after defeat, due to human beings' motivation of 
dominance if not stability and equality. Meritocracies that fail to account 
for their exclusions, therefore, will encounter opposition to their 
decisive status. Meritocratic processes are, in fact, unfair on the 
premise that not all human beings are born equally capable in action 
and identical in identification; to compensate for these differences, many 
societies implement the workaround of deeming every human being equal 
solely on the criteria that they exist. There are also group identities, 
such as class, familial bloodlines, and occupation to further distinguish 
individual human beings. Some noteworthy instances demonstrate how 
self-interest does not always align with merit of performance. The 
1492 expulsion of Jews from Spain, due to reasons such as their 
financial success that outsized that of the predominantly Catholic 
populace there, resulted in many Jews having to leave Spain or to convert 
to Catholicism, in which some still practiced Judaism as crypto-Jews. 
The 1972 expulsion of Indians from Uganda was also due to a perception 
of the minority demographic becoming too commercially influential. In 
the decisions of these two events, the principle of qualitative existence (the 
minority identity) was a greater factor than the merit of performance.
The young mathematician Evariste Galois, of potential unmet to expand 
on his already pioneering mathematics, lost his life in a physical duel 
(1832), a fate that demonstrates how merit in one human activity is not 
a default cause for merit in a distinct activity. The downside of merit 
is that human beings must somehow design judgment of it, in ways that 
coincide with satisfaction of self-interest. The case of Oda Nobunaga 
was what occurred when the merit of political status was no longer 
found by civil consensus. Oda Nobunaga launched a campaign, in the 
1560's, to unify all of Japan, this being possible only by violent

Human beings, given all the options conceived by their cognition and the 
demands relayed to them of immediate and long-term dues, prioritize their 
objectives, and this shifts their focus of thought and action into 
constraints for the possibilities from their independent doings. A failed 
objective is reminded of in terms of the past, and in cases of self-interest 
persisting to achieve that objective again, the objective is still there 
for another attempt. The efforts undertaken by human beings, in arrangements 
of individuals and group organizations, bear effects that can always be gauged 
on gradients of those centered around change and novelty (a change from 
the norms of change). The idea of "change" may have a resonance in tone 
perceived by some people in the lens of fear. This is a common occurrence, out 
of interpreting the broadness of "change" into the existential specifics, 
since any human activity of thought or action is technically a change from 
the past. This fact is a consequence of the greater truth that stems from 
perception: the past, the present, and the future are each distinct categories 
of spatiotemporal contexts. There are perspectives on the wholesomeness of 
this truth. On the idea of some people fearing "change", the only rationale 
for the fear is that it is an effect from their belief in the negative gains 
they are to suffer if that "change" were to be actualized. Man, in his confidence 
of ignorance or helplessness, when no longer driven by his self-interest to engage 
in much pondering and debating, finds satisfaction in the idiom, "history repeats 
itself", an idiom that encourages self-fulfilling courses of future action, due in 
ways to the excellence of human beings in activities of patterned construction and 
replication. The requirement of self-interest to act as an economical force, by 
prioritizing the ordering of all that is to be done, the objectives, by importance 
is what follows from the human beings' lack of satisfaction with static conservation. 
For the human being, their self-interest demands their physical movement, mental 
exercise, and purposes for achievement through action or possession of the material 
not immediately attainable. The human being that is not demanded to think much will 
then allocate their mental energies into physical activities, and in cases of their 
physical activity yielding unwanted results, is as devoid of rational thought on 
the negative consequences of their physical efforts, as their lack of mental efforts 
had them be. The human being, incapable of physical activity past thresholds of a 
combination of their mental restraints and physical aptitude, could be as demanding 
as a king that cannot fight his own battles. There is a big point of complication to 
know the specifics of the priorities from self-interest, and that is the demands 
of self-interest are the preferences in choice. There can be many options presented 
to the self, but by the innate autonomy to accept or reject alongside there not 
being any known consequences from the decision, the self chooses its preferences. 
The finiteness of a human being gives reason for their prioritization. And so, an 
objective that a human being fails in upholding, thus forsaking some of their 
responsibilities from demand, can be explained by them through the premise that 
their finiteness makes them fallible. But because the premise is part of the kernel 
for all of individual human existence, any explanation that satisfies rigor of reason 
must be one that cannot immediately state the premise as the sole cause, for there 
were too many causes and effects that occurred, and those causes were likewise 
options for the human being to decide to act on. In matters of transparent and fair 
accountability, the human being that can prove, without reason for any other doubt, 
that the best of their abilities could not produce the wanted outcomes, even though 
their abilities were for what was recognized as the best course of decisions, is 
not at fault in other human beings' accounting of them. Even so, the previous 
statement is complicated by the diversification of action that then must be 
attributed back to it, in terms of what is "best" and what was "wanted". A 
self, when not beholden to demands, is a self without purpose, walking around 
with an eye for nothing and may stumble upon an unknown fortune, by which they 
must judge as pure coincidence when they have no contextual information on 
how the happening occurred. Siddhartha Guatama, the Indian prince that gave up 
his status, did so out of his demands. According to sources, Guatama grew weary 
and insane of his royal life. Anyone that is aware of the potential extents of 
moral compromise and depravity, a threatening staple in the internal workings 
of any political body, would suppose Guatama gave up his royal life for something 
far more ethical. One of the greatest moral lessons in regards to Guatama, the 
founder of Buddhism, is that political power, so heavily leaned towards the 
relativity of human beings ruling over human beings, is disappointingly temporary, 
and that the better option for some people, gifted into privileged status, is 
to give up their roles of status when those roles are so intertwined with the putrid 
anti-power of base and untempered demands, in order to live lives satisfying to 
their souls, equivalently, in alignment with their self-interests. Human beings, 
when considered purely as "political animals", pose the same fundamental danger in 
civilized or barbarian societies, albeit the qualities of thinking and behaving are 
different between the two kinds of societies, hence the different labels. And that danger is 
economical decisions for expected gains and losses, the process and execution both 
impossible for the deliberate human being if not for the force of self-interest. 
All kinds of ironic plots have occurred throughout human history, and politics 
has always been a prevalent theme. Consider this. A former friend becomes a political 
agent, strikes deals with antagonists, and thinks that their newfound alliances 
will spare them a fate quite the opposite of state-imposed death penalty. And the 
former friend is promoted by society to a lord of sorts over a dominion where they 
were once at most an equal in talent and the worst of the criminal, relatively 
speaking. Chains of events such as these are surprising when one prioritizes 
friendships over politics. When politics is the primary aim, the saying, "there 
are no friends in politics", works as a more accurate wisdom on the nature of this 
category of activity. Misogyny is a consequence of certain kinds of prioritizations 
by self-interest that must operate in the social construct. Young males, out of 
a combination of their naivety and stupidity, metaphorically drop their jaws at 
the sight of pretty women. Through experiences that heavily involve social status 
and material possessions, certain males grow into men that are deeply dissatisfied 
with the demographic of women. In societies where women are granted less rights in 
ownership, there is the instant assumption from these men that the perceived 
affection from some women is due to the motive of their wanting control over 
the men's properties. Regardless of the property rights by gender, women's typically 
weaker physical strength and household occupation gives credibility to some 
of their stereotypes. Women are not the upfront representative to causes, and 
instead resort to whispering narratives in others' ears for their own socio-economically 
driven conspiracies. The archetypal murderess uses poison instead of guns 
and knives. Historically, there are more prostitutes that are female than male. 
A misogynist does not believe in the love from feminine nature, due to their 
incredulity at the structured causality chains that help to orchestrate the 
occurrence of man meeting woman, for the possibility to continue on as lovers. 
And these causality chains very much rest on merits revolving around socio-economic 
status, not too different from political pragmatics. The progressions of a 
civilization, through advancements in industry and reform to its civil codes, 
correspond to less violent political activity by its populace. Most men no 
longer need to carry firearms, out of their self-interests for self-defense, due 
to the relativity of their peers also not carrying firearms. The politicker 
no longer needs to be vocal or physical to an adversary; instead, through 
word of mouth, the politicker influences another politicker and another 
such that networks are formed to impoverish and persecute the adversary. 
Herein these statements on civilization, one can see how human beings 
engage in tradeoffs, and still suffer the same in states of emotions, 
due in great part to the same thematic motives that drive self-interest, 
with the undeniable changes, arguably called improvements, being the means 
for the objectives that serve those motives. It can be argued that human 
beings are inconsiderate to inevitable suffering when they prioritize their 
objectives. Priority matters for capability, and although the status of capability 
is relative, the utilization of capability against the incapable bears objective 
effects, usually much to the chagrin of the incapable.

For all the glories and magnificence that human expression is alleged to 
offer, there are certainly drawbacks. Also of certainty is human expression, 
varying in representation from region to region around Earth, has subjective 
qualities that are coincidentally some of the more revered qualities of the 
respective region, the cultural identifiers, per se. The ubiquitous field of 
deception, deliberate in action or innate by appearance, produces falsehoods 
of information inaccurately comprehended by interpreters. Deception by innate 
appearance is, despite the frequent potential for physical violence, as in the 
case of the camouflaged predatory snake, comprehended by objective measures. 
Challenges exist for measurements of this category of deception, due to both 
retellings from personal experiences and the necessary technology for measures. 
For example, the sheer number of chemicals toxic to human beings is already 
overwhelming, if not for an encyclopediac knowledge of toxicology, and many 
of these chemicals are not detectable by the five senses. But at least there is 
the binary response of knowing or not knowing what the substance is. Deception by 
action, specifically that of human beings, has a difficulty in interpretation 
proportional to the hardness of the information games at play. Therein the 
information games lies the deception in compartmentalized and shifty forms. 
Competent manifestations of deception could be due to pertinent unknowns remaining 
unknowns, thus exponentiating doubt that could drastically distort the interpreter's 
cognitive faculties, and to the fluidity of changing circumstances that manipulate 
the interpreter's priorities in the context of the deception. In simple cases, 
where one knows the objective and exactly the answer for that objective of an 
adversarial other, behind their metaphorical mask, there occurs some dynamics that 
could be considered dishonest. They choose the setting they think is appropriate 
to express to the adversarial other their understanding of the matter, in the form 
of their wanted response for what they believe is that adversarial other's objective. 
As clarification, the term "understanding", used to describe this decision, is not 
those lines of thinking required to satisfy a comprehensive and accurate knowledge of the matter. 
For all practical matters of grave adversarial concern, the choice setting of the 
change-of-face is the outward determinant in the signifying of bi-directional adversarial 
relations between the two. Self-interest, being that force dependent on the will and 
the will dependent on the motivation, is the last metaphysical driver of motive for 
the human being. And the motive, as what comes out of motivation, is broad and so 
heavily contaminated with the passions that in order for the motive to have any 
significance for the human being, the human being must formulate objectives to 
pacify the imbalance in their motivation because of that motive. As with any expansive 
concept, motive can be split into dichotomies of dark and light. In one orthodox 
classification, the dark motives include fear, hate, and vengeance. The light motives 
revolve around peace. And thus, by these examples of motives, there is a point to be 
made on these metaphysical bodies: they have no directed meaning, in and of themselves, 
and the human being is aware of them only by their feeling of the presence. Yet, 
self-interest is indeed affected by the presence of these metaphysical bodies, since 
said bodies do skew the directionality of the dependency that is the will. The dark 
motives, especially, tend to raise more division between self-interest and certain 
elements of the external world, such as other people. In cases where the dark motives 
are domineering influences onto self-interest, there is the immediate transformation of 
the dark motives into the corresponding object, such as another human being, and from 
that transformation, the formulation of the objective on how to deal with the object ensues. 
The light motives, on the other hand, are not predisposed to that dynamic, yet can be 
condoning of ignorance instead of innocence, apathy instead of impartiality, and 
complacency instead of vigilance, since this category of metaphysical bodies is not 
as quick in transforming into the information that is the corresponding object. The 
characteristics of light and dark motives that have been stated are both incomplete 
and not entirely accurate. In practice, light motives can become predisposed to 
associating with existential aspects to the self, such as home, family, and significant 
other. Associations such as these do constrain the focus of these motives towards 
objects and identities, and since any object or identity is merely a candidate in 
a seemingly infinite set of candidates, these motives become coupled with bias. A universal 
problem for human existence, worthy to note so as to demonstrate the complication of 
purist application of "light" or "dark" into personal settings. And the possible changes 
in motive, through temporal continuity, are counter-analytic to the task of static 
ascription of a particular self-interest to light or dark motives. An expression 
is as significant as the immediate meaning and the ends out of that meaning. Due 
primarily to this truth, it has become common for militaries, dating back 
to at least the Ancient Greek period, to don attire in uniform, so as to mask 
individual meaning for the presentation of a whole of indistinguishable components. 
The lack of perceptible expression is also expression, due to such reasons as 
existence necessitating meaning for that existence, as well as the understanding 
of expression in terms of at least one spectrum, each starting from null. This 
is proven by the case of a non-vocal individual actually being a significant 
influence; their expression is there in action, just not channeled by their 
verbal communication. There are no universal guidelines for responses to deceptive 
expression. Without this kind of expression bearing effects deemed negative, by 
consensus, the guidelines would be judged as something along the lines of dictatorial. 
When one is deceptive by "innate appearance", others will have faulty presumptions 
on that one. The others interpret that one as something contrary to their actual 
what-is; the interpretation is not completely contained in meaning with that of 
the what-is, in other words. For purposes of accountability, the others, out of their 
being pro-active by being presumptuous, are the ones at fault. But if the one were to 
be deceptive through their actions, then by the basis of their being the one pro-active 
for that quality of output, that one would be at fault. In both of these statements, 
there are the judgments of deception as absolutely a fault, a break from the 
forthrightness of the actual, and pro-action being more willful than null-action to 
deception. Cases of those that do not reveal the actual meaning behind the supposed 
deceptive expression are to be categorized as deceivers by innate appearance, then, 
for completeness in consideration of how deception manifests.

Human beings are frequently likened to other animals, through use of metaphors that 
place emphatic importance on the individuals' specific traits, a trade-off in literal 
accuracy for a description of their modus operandi. The use of animal metaphors to 
describe certain human beings is also reinforced by historical stereotypes about 
animal traits; the eagle is a creature of raw power and capability, the lion is a king 
of his pride, the fox is a canine of trickery, et cetera. The units of human language 
suffer from the weakness of not being able to produce comprehendible meaning without 
knowledge of the corresponding phenomena, and the phenomena must be represented in some 
form if not outright experienced by an individual, for any individual to be able to produce 
understanding of meaning on the units. Perhaps this fact also serves as a cause for deception 
through action of communication via human language. To address possible miscomprehension of 
this fact, fabrication of a phenomenon by human beings is essentially fallacy by misrepresenting 
the actuality behind it. The mention of the snake, in section 57, was to describe the 
category of deception by innate appearance. But the example is too literal to reproduce 
the exactness of deception by the snake, hiding in camouflage with its surroundings, 
with the human being deceptive by innate appearance. There is the appearance, this being 
the literal exemplification of innate of the human being, that can be deceptive. For 
example, a human being that has done something out of the ordinary, such as a grisly 
crime, that is amongst those that are their ethnicity and gender, will be more difficult for 
analysts to differentiate from the others, based on physical appearance, as the one solely 
responsible. But the human being is understood by an observer not only through their outward 
appearance, their from-oneself attribute. Human beings have a memory rich due not to the vast 
storage of the human brain, for the human brain's capacity of accurate recollection pales in 
comparison to that of the metallic determination of digital and electronic computers, due 
in part to the sways and leanings that produce associative memory. An individual, past their 
physical appearance, is one considered partly through accounting and narration by other human beings. 
One that knows an individual through such things as hearsay and their recorded heritage will 
already have formed presumptions on that individual, before any potential direct experience 
with them. The human being, fundamentally a rational agent by arguments that stress their 
sources of livelihood through maintaining integration with their social construct and improvement 
if not maintenance of their occupations, uses inferential reasoning to deal with doubt. Temporal 
beliefs to act and think in confidence, if just for the moment in cases where the inferences 
are both essentially incorrect and proved to be incorrect. So the human being is a 
social agent, due to the two primary reasons that they have to exist in some kind 
of social construct and their interactions with and perceptions from other human beings. 
And so, the human being cannot literally be a snake in their specifics of practice. 
The social construct of the human being and the presumptions from an other of that 
human being is that human being's camouflage. The human being has many methodologies 
to inflict harm. In the more abstract sense, the human being's innate appearance can 
be deceptive, due to interpretations of them that do not focus on that human being's 
inherent traits, qualities that help to form the understanding of their from-oneself. 
The innate appearance of the human being deceptive to an interpreter implies the 
interpreter's knowledge of that human being's attributes of as-is and what-is is 
inaccurate. The "political animal" and "social creature" perspectives of the human 
being make perception of them not constrained to their perceptible qualities. 
The networked arrangements of human societies make the human being's innate appearance 
have impact that extends outside of direct interaction with them, unlike the pertinence 
of the camouflaged snake, a creature relevant to a human being due only to the two simple 
categories of direct physical interaction with them, in which the human being may die by 
that snake's direct doing, and the snake's physical qualities of interest, such as its 
venom. For the first category of the snake's relevance, the parallel to the human being 
is complicated by the possibilities of human existence. The roles of an executioner, a 
judge, and a legislator demand different actions. A human being could be a representative 
or a commander, and from the degree of prestige that these two titles carry, that human 
being is associated with capabilities outside of their direct doings. The innate appearance 
of a human being is that of attempted understanding of them in terms of social and narrative 
relations. This is the conclusion due to the quality of associative memory that human cognition 
operates with, as well as the inferences that human beings make about others due to pertaining 
information that is either essentially incorrect or interpreted into incorrect beliefs. 
The deception category of innate appearance for the human being is expected to have a 
convolutionary relation with the category of deception in action. For the intents and 
purposes of maintaining a hard divide between the two categories, consider the one of 
innate appearance to be the kernel of knowledge that another human being uses to 
understand them and decide on their forecasts of them. This kernel of knowledge is not 
truthful enough in cases of deception, and the use of this kernel as the base to further 
action could very well inadvertently benefit the deceptive human being with or without 
their additional deceptive actions. And a human being's deception by action could 
lead to their innate appearance, received as information by another human being, to be 
deceptive to that other human being. The term "innate", as used in this categorization, 
should not be interpreted strictly in a biological or visual sense, for as already elaborated 
on, the associations of social significance and inferred truths that can be attached to a human 
being are what influences another human being's perception of them, this their "innate appearance". 

## More on philosophies of self-interest #59 

One of the perks of civilization is that there are more opportunities for human beings 
to project their images without use of physical violence. The from-oneself attribute of one 
human being is not too different from any other human being. There are three points 
to the from-oneself: the human being's existence as life, the human being's appearance, 
and the human being's mortality. The human being's capabilities and accomplishments 
are entirely dismissed from this attribute. There is no image other than the human 
being's physical appearance that is projected. The clothing that a human being wears 
is expression for some objective, such as warmth or status, and so, is not 
of the from-oneself attribute. This attribute is one in the semblance of humility, 
unlike the attributes of the as-is and what-is. Due to this truth, human beings of 
status seldom speak and act solely for the expression of their from-oneself attribute, 
and the ones that are of a low status along certain metrics also practice liberties of 
not confining their expression to this attribute, although typical limitations such as 
money force the virtues of these ones to be geared towards outlets subject to judgments 
by those of status. The aristocrat never views the commoner in the same light as them, 
and the aristocrat's possible egalitarian policies must be causes out of their pragmatics. 
Even the bureaucrat of democratic institutions has cognitive metrics to differentiate, 
and may view their peers from youth and their current affiliations to be something other, 
this being possible only when the from-oneself attribute is not the only attribute in 
consideration. The as-is attribute of a human being gives another human being cause, 
out of their understanding, to consider that human being in terms of utility and 
positive usefulness of utility. And the what-is attribute occasionally is the cause 
for unexpected effects, since the human being can know another's as-is through their five 
senses and still never come close to knowing that other's motives and objectives, an 
important part of their what-is. A human being can be misconstrued, estimated in all 
the ways that lead to falsehoods of belief on them, due to their de facto and de jure 
roles in the greater context of their society (part of their as-is). A human being that 
is recognized as a great one in a field is somewhat expected by others to consistently 
demonstrate their excellence in that field. An inference from this is that an excellent 
scientist by reputation is expected to be more consistent in being an outstanding performer 
than the politician, since the work of a politician produces effects in which they are 
not entirely responsible for but nevertheless, somehow is credited these effects from their 
rule through commands and policies. In fact, the politician can only be an exemplar of the 
Great Man theory in the sense of social representation, whereas the discoveries of a scientist 
may coincidentally lead to their becoming socially known, by the institutional light of 
prestige shone on them. This is a perspective that assumes the will of each human being 
is that for what the human being comprehends as their self-interest, and the notion of 
the human being's lack of autonomy that could be dualistically considered selflessness 
is, in fact, a denial of their self-interest, placing them on the same level as botanical 
life. The roles assigned to a human being and recognized by other human beings encourage 
presumptions about that human being, and these presumptions may, in turn, be completely 
negligent of the domineering motives (part of the what-is) in that human being, so that 
entertaining that human being as one that has certain objectives is far-fetched by the partial 
reasoning. The feat of understanding another human being cannot ever be on the whole of 
their existence since birth. The motives, alone, of a human being cannot be objectively 
recognized in real-time. Furthermore, there are cases in which "understanding" is the 
term used by human beings to refer to another human being's compliance with some matter, 
typically as a social relation. This definition of this word, in these contexts, is 
fit for authoritative settings, where the command structure is what is most important, 
while most human sentiments are viewed as unseemly, perhaps cause for exploitation of their weaknesses 
in opportune circumstances. Convolution of the qualities of a human being's from-oneself, 
as-is, and what-is produces mixed meanings from comprehending that human being. The proof 
of this statement is not done through this writing. However, there are plenty of examples 
in literature and film that have used this kind of convolution to exemplify the gray-like 
morality of human beings, how human beings are a subject of their environment and must 
constantly be one with nurture instead of the nature that is a great part of their social 
construct they call "civilization", how the "serf" is actually a superior fighter and 
lover than the "knight", et cetera. For another example, consider how much influence 
of hard and soft power the person of status has, and juxtaposing of this quality 
of theirs with their compliments and other expressions of virtue-signaling promotes 
reason to cast doubt on them; it may be believed that their as-is attribute only 
serves as a cover in order to not betray the malice of their what-is to anyone else, 
save for a select few. And the politician that speaks such noble words, seemingly 
inexperienced in the specific kinds of monstrosities at play, calmly signs a document, 
demonstrative of the power of the pen over the sword after that signing produces a 
legitimacy for causes such as war and impoverishment. By the practice of correspondence 
theory, the politician in these cases can never be any more guilty than the most 
innocent acting person responsible for the faults authorized by their legislation. And 
the ire that is directed against them must be due to their being the upfront human 
representation of these disapproved causes. The Russian Revolution of 1905 serves 
as an example of the absolutist possibility in attribution, in which all that were connected 
to what was believed to be fault, were declared to be guilty, and the human representatives 
of rule were most vehemently opposed. Differences, both nuanced and stark, culminated into 
exacerbation of class war between the aristocrat and commoner factions, build-ups in tension released 
into armed conflict. Civilization encourages liberties not found in wartime situations. 
Accumulation of wealth and acquisition of fame are two of the common categories of de jure 
power that can be used by a human being to project their image, in their desired perfection 
and limited scale in recipients of the image. The saying, "all war is a symptom of man's failure 
as a thinking animal" by John Steinbeck, is a general effect due to the lack of 
effectiveness in some images projected from human beings, especially those representative 
of peace, prosperity, and egalitarianism. The proponents of physical war no longer see the 
value in these images, composed of select qualities from the from-oneself, as-is, and what-is 
of some human beings, and furthermore, see no use for pacifist occupations. In physical war, 
the what-is attribute becomes less pertinent than the as-is (an explanation for the 
inhumanity), and knowledge of the as-is is valuable only for the pragmatics of exacerbating 
harm to the enemy, as far as death, in other words, minimizing the enemy's instances of 
from-oneself. Human beings' projections of image are enabled by the rich communicative 
styles developed by human beings, and can only continue on so long as the degree of positive 
reception to these images, indicative of compatibilities between the expected and the promises, 
passes a satisfactory threshold. 

## More on philosophies of self-interest #60 

Self-interest's lack of containment, in order to persist in its host, is one of this 
force's qualities that is supported by acclimation mechanisms. In the paradigm of 
socio-economics, these acclimation mechanisms result in norms for culture and status. 
Individual human beings that set upon doing a task, in the style of repetition and 
auxiliary activities to support that repetition, become versed in that task. Physical 
strength can be enhanced, and cognitive abilities can be refined for more efficient 
and accurate application. A norm of a class of phenomena is established in ways that 
lead to proclivities in perception of that phenomena, actions and appearances by human 
beings geared around if not in official semblance of the norm. In this sense, the norm 
can be either end of the extrema or the mean, and what distinguishes the norm is that 
it is what is inadvertently or directly upheld by the corresponding human beings. On 
the other hand, in many societies, a predominant number of human beings can be completely 
clueless on the extrema and the mean, and the society seemingly operates completely 
fine according to their official statements, with minumum organized protest obviously 
because there is no mass awareness of the bounds and centralities of the class of a phenomena 
to protest against or for. Without shared linguistic terms and other unifying symbols, 
members of social interactions compensate for the lack of common operands in expression 
with instinct and intuition, those bodies that can produce accurate outputs in judgment 
yet cannot be readily and wholly understood by transmitting the representation of their 
metaphysical principles, typically through human language, to another. Social norms are 
artificial axioms that characterize societies, and linguistic statements that accurately 
describe these artificial axioms do, in fact, constitute security concerns to arbitrary 
extents. For simplicity's sake in elaborating more on what exactly these security 
concerns are, consider the fact that a stranger, someone not well-known to others by 
similar cultural nurture and personal interactions, can blend in with these others by 
knowing what artificial axioms (the norms) to practice, and the stranger just so happens 
to have bad intentions. This example is one on a particular stranger, not strangers in 
general, since there are plenty of counter-argumentative cases where acceptance of 
strangers can be more beneficial than standing by those people familiar, such as a citizen 
of a nation that would rather rob or kill their fellow citizens than a foreigner, the 
biblical story of brothers Abel and Cain where one died by the other's hand, and in 
a historical legend somewhat similar to this biblical story, brother Romulus killing 
Remus to establish Rome. On the matter of knowing principle, games involving decisions 
and outcomes would be conducted with much doubt when one side does not have artificial 
axioms to believe in about the other. On a related note, the grandeur of a general 
statement, such as the previous on what is to happen given some circumstances, can 
always be readily contradicted if there is no specified application, but then there 
would not be anything striking to state, only that every aspect that can be dualized 
should be equal throughout in quality. The property of acclimation that is a part of 
self-interest most definitely has a biological basis, and that is the finiteness of 
human effort from required caloric intake. The spirit, per se, that accepts or rejects 
a point in an endeavour's travel as the wanted stasis is much more interesting in 
exemplifying discussions, but alas, that would be subjective and beg for more questions. 
Matters of aesthetic preferences and wanted experiences are also acclimative by self-interest. 
A plausible theory for this is because human cognition, of perception and judgment, greatly 
takes into account the expected and the actual. The actualities surrounding a human being demand 
their response in some form, and their expectations can well be relegated to the realm 
of motives instead of the objectives of self-interest, which are typically designed for 
non-null possibilities. Human beings can find the comfort of peace in their experiences so 
long as they continue to live. For example, funeral events that honor the dead are rife with 
upset or solemn people. But eventually, every single attendant of healthy mentality moves 
on in some way, and remembrances of that dead one are frequently phrased as them "living 
on in the heart". In other words, there was acclimation to that death: the upset feelings 
right after the event were neutralized to regain the comfort of peace, a possible source 
of stability, to move on from that. Acclimation produces a stable base for self-interest 
to continue on in its own way. And if the acclimation becomes cultural custom, questioning 
of the matters for that acclimation would be labeled phrases such as "culturally offensive". 
This could be used to support the argument of the self-justifying quality of self-interest 
having a preference for the destinations of acclimation processes. But this argument also 
has many examples against it, such as in national progressivism and innovation. The experiences 
in both of these categories deal with divergences from norms and are rationalized as 
necessary, out of the circumstances. The difference in typical mass acceptance is that 
national progressivism is accepted as the general trend and the specifics in hardships 
due, in part, to divergences from more comfortable norms are the causes for personal 
dissatisfaction. Innovative products have merit due to being specific improvements for solutions, 
but have to be more difficult to integrate into the whole to cause a different kind of whole. 
The inability of a human being to find content in their surroundings is celebrated from 
time to time. The idea of the best artists being tortured souls, in their waking lives, 
has a persuasion to it due to its rational-like characterization of the lives some of 
these people led. The fledgling ancient Roman Republic is also an example of a 
self-improving mentality that cannot possibly be indicative of an acclimation thorough 
in certain aspects. A quote from Cicero in Haruspices goes, "and it is not numbers 
that we are superior to the Spaniards, nor in personal strength to the Gauls, nor in 
cunning to the Carthaginians, nor in arts to the Greeks". And yet, the incorporatist 
ancient state of Rome grew to accomodate all these peoples that did not perish under the 
classic Roman gladius.

Norms, as artificial axioms, are not entirely for constructive purposes although they 
provide the bases for stability that are, in turn, required by spheres of influence 
to efficiently operate and command consistent relevance in the manner of projection. 
Stability comes in many forms, with regards to contexts of human beings, so much that 
the only objectively measurable characteristics of the concept are through the socio-economic 
labels, belonging to one comprehensive labeling system that is correctly used, of specific 
individuals. The field of socio-economics, being as ubiquitious in the applications of 
human activity as it is, focuses much on the material possessions and political status of 
individuals in a region. Because of this focus, the practical uses of socio-economics is 
usually not sufficient in the depth of description on the cultural hallmarks and spiritual 
mores of a people. With this said, the concept of humanist stability cannot possibly be 
discussed in a unified way, due to the subjectivity of human acceptance, for a slap in 
the face in an ordered land is to be received with humility and need for redemption, 
but in an unordered land, cause to escalate conflict. In gauging stability for a region, 
the opportunities available to an arbitrary individual to diverge from their prescribed 
routes are much more relevant than the regional industries available to that individual for 
possible employment. However, the two are intricately connected. The concept of the artificial 
axiom is thorough because it can transform into describing any action that any individual does 
or will do and any predominant belief promoted by any group of individuals. And as for the cause for these 
artificial axioms, the root is obviously self-interest. Norms are a class of artificial 
axioms, and although they have significance proportional to corresponding effects from their 
representatives and proponents, they serve as effects from frequent kinds of acceptances. 
The artificial axiom could additionally act as causes, from self-interest, for effects, 
all the same. Artificial axioms capture the operating principles of human perception and action, 
in the global sense all the way down to the individual. And the reason why not all artificial 
axioms are revered as much as the typical norm is due to their contradicting choice in 
practical application. A norm may be denounced, but the fact that it is a more frequent 
consideration in human beings' self-interests gives it a reinforced defense against opponents, 
those that may rely on the causes from their reasoning for why their desired effects of 
defying the norm is justified. In this way, human reasoning for preferred ends makes 
all these reasons questionable, which then explains why all relevant democratic nations, 
since time immemorial, depend on institutions to thrive in the co-existences of subjective 
interpretation of democracy in partial practice, and ironically, why institutions of 
any nation, democratic or not, cannot blindly guarantee liberation. There are fixtures, these 
norms, and human activity cannot be "business as usual" when liberation leaves behind it 
null voids that make their societies cave in from the change. Fear of these kinds of null 
voids are indeed a part of human design of human societies, as shown by drastic events such as 
the character Brutus who said he "loved Caesar, but... loved Rome more" in Shakespeare's 
Julius Caesar, sometime around his decision to help kill Caesar, and the American Civil War 
of 1861. Both events were essentially caused by and for institutions, and perhaps the defeats 
of both Brutus and Robert E. Lee were due to their love for their institutions, so great that 
their cognition was clouded to such extents to spin them round and round down the holes for 
their defeats, psycho-analytically speaking. Social norms are a product of the "social creature" 
that is the human being, strived for by individuals and established through the sheer acceptance 
by the populace. The competitive spirit of human beings help to oscillate acceptance on the 
forms pertaining to the norm, and the actualities through the course of time by human beings 
are the sole body of variables that determine what the norm is, a fixture of sorts more stable 
than temporary, more subject than object, and artificial axiom instead of axiom. All the things 
that have been thought, dreamt of, and occurred through thorough action turn into an incomplete 
knowledge for the minds of the present, and acceptance of this incomplete knowledge, further modified 
through variants of retellings, then culminates into norms that treat most of the past as 
the phenomena of specific forms, predominated in actualization by human beings' choice use 
of artificial axioms. But there is no saying on the obsolescence of these artificial axioms, 
metaphysical decision structures. The continuity of cultures and perspectives past the 
individual human beings' death is quite evident, more so than the official name 
of any previous empire that reigned for some hundred of years in some region of the planet. The 
fact that there are always less novelties than anti-novelties is the effect of the physical 
constructs that certain human beings labored for, and this fact itself hides the nuances of 
the forms from the same artificial axiom practically diverged into specific spatiotemporal 
settings. Societies steadfast on maintaining certain norms are ones that directly intend for their 
human subjects to be subjected to these norms, one of the primary ways to attempt persistence 
through the possibly violent advents brought about through universal time and from changes in 
ways of life from those others not of society. An arbitrary farmer in a village below the 
technological norm of the great powers of nation states is limited in technological perspective and 
may be unmotivated to technologically improve, and what debates without the material 
can really prove their inferiority to civilized technocrats without there being statements 
very much offensive to their way of life, the norms for their labor? Behind every enduring 
norm is physical reinforcement, a result from demands to help institutionalize the rule. 
In the context of the norm, self-interest makes the human being an actor in their personal 
circumstances, possibly an opportunist when the norms they support are what they believe is 
most beneficial, not necessarily what would yield them the best. And for that, human beings 
are mostly normal, despite the complementary degree of their actions for the norms surrounding 
them of the present day. Also noteworthy to mention, the acceptance of what is believed to 
have occurred and the norms continued or established upon these beliefs are actually a great 
cause for the growth in the dark motives. For example, hatred persists, and the deliberation 
and the opportune nature of manifesting it constitute qualities that distinguish this motive 
from most of the others. On top of the world a human being can be mentally, even socio-economically, 
and if their position relied so much on their advantages due to the norms of their people, then 
naturally, it is never too crazy for them to have discomforting thoughts from time to time, 
since they the norm are responsible for the control of human competition, yet what have they 
other than integrity and deception to compensate for their finite standing in this non-static 
world?

It can be stated, with confidence of such resonance to be insult, that every instance of 
self-interest will come across decision junctions, time to time, that are nothing short 
of their host being deceived into thinking that there is decision, instead the available options 
of the classic single route and single mind, two options as two equal solutions, and all 
the other formats thought to be possible might just be there to lead to disappointment 
through betrayal or will-taking pacification. When these possibilities, of the 
believed choice buttressed by nothing supportive, are entertained, already there are 
restructurizations of self-interest from the will's typically haywire re-calibration of 
its directionality, since such believed choice entertained to yield anticipatory happiness 
without present results is retracted, and with the retraction comes a re-evaluation of what is 
still left that can only occur when one's will is not at terms with one directionality. 
If only this writing contained a poem to elucidate on this kind of phenomenon, there would 
be questions on its inclusion meaning blind sympathy for those that have had these 
experiences. There do come times in which one's reaction to the deception on possibilities 
is so overwhelming to their cognitive faculties, they that think they did not deserve that 
null, that they become dangerous to everyone related to that deception. And sometimes, these 
ones get their lives cut short after some arbitrary progress in their adversarial pursuits. 
The choice to abstain is always there, albeit not guaranteed to prevent unwanted consequences. 
And there are indeed doubts on the virtues of abstaining from certain courses of action, 
truly. These doubts are derived from notions on the so-called innermost essence of decision 
chains declared to be representative of virtue. Another source of derivation for these 
notions is the perceived gains and losses, financially and otherwise, from said decision 
chains. Many will say poverty is a virtue, due to those in poverty not partaking in excesses 
especially of material and privilege. Poverty of the mind cannot be virtuous, ever, because 
not only is it a scant and almost meaningless base of knowledge, the mind is also not naive 
due to personal experience, and there is willful need to keep that quality of knowledge intact 
to exacerbate faults that cannot be corrected so long as the faults transform into vices, 
and these vices "autocorrected" by the swirling conservatory of vices, a kind of clockwork 
commendable if only efficiency and performance constitute the categories of qualities measured 
for the judgment. Poverty provides an acclimation to the unfulfilled aura of living, and it is 
the perception that the force of self-interest has found solace in the imbalance of unfulfillment, 
labeled "acclimation", that conserves matters necessary to continue on the present state of affairs; 
on a related note, it is almost entirely certain that an arbitrary philanthropist voices views 
that go somewhere along the lines of "poverty is virtue", since they are usually intent to 
remain as one giving the capital under assumptions of the giving being good. Transformations 
undergone by human beings, as part of the reactionary chained process that develops character 
and values, from infantile implication, supposedly needless to say, to those notions voiced 
and stood for in phrases of all ways for each of them. This is where the archetype of the good 
judge of character and values is pertinent: to state that a particular human being is "good" is 
more challenging than their being "innocent", for in one, there are constraints of the potential, 
the other, the powers and structures that never showed their faces to test the supposedly "innocent". 
The good judge of character and values does make errors, from time to time, and perhaps this 
cannot all be due to indiscrepancies of empirical knowledge. And these errors are a category 
of instances for the output of a shocked "world": there was the expectation, but however, 
these events occurred, so the "world" is now at a loss for words, ignores the words from 
that point on received, by the assumption that the words mean something else. 
"A break of trust" is an accurate phrasing for this. The practical nature of the human being 
means that their self-interest almost instinctually resorts to wielding tools and commanding 
respect, however those acts may be, in their spatio-temporal norms of existing. Pragmatics 
becomes routine, routine becomes maintenance, and maintenance becomes corrosive dread. The 
statement assumes all else in the temporal course is equal, which would be difficult if not 
for steadfast intention from self-interest in support of the specified machination. Why 
must the choice be there? The question supposes that rule will always be considered for 
choice on any matter. If there are rules to prohibit, self-interest is probably predisposed 
towards the outlets the rule guards against. A question of trust for there to have to be 
artificial axioms declared to restructure original decision-making towards wanted decisions. 
How man would rather understand a human being to cripple or kill them at a decided time, and 
woman rather share in responsibility and provide certain things for them so as to deprive and 
rob them at decided times, instead of being free from and with the human being are simply due to 
the pragmatics of control through connectivity. When noble minds, after undergoing misfortune 
of what is fate from their perspective, call themselves unlucky, their self-interests are not 
inquisitive but accepting of what has occurred. But when self-interest feels tested past the point 
of the test being honorable such that the administrator of the test must have an ungainly and 
deplorable pleasure in being of that position, there is the natural tendency towards anger, so 
that if the test is successfully passed, the result is toward rejection of the "prize" of what was 
restricted. It is not only because choice is not always there, but also because the specific 
choice now given cannot possibly be taken because of the kind of receptance to the prior 
experience, although the potential is still there; self-interest is predictable yet not, 
something like Schrodinger's Cat. Some call this way of living a pathological life, counter 
to all the ends prescribed by some group of human beings. But that is still decision from 
self-interest, and the metaphysical cannot be disease without host. Why is it, when it 
comes to reason, that nothing seems to be spared in the longevity of belief, practice, and 
possession save for deception?

The "foederati", "phoiderati", and "symmachoi" of Ancient Rome are modern-day terms 
used to describe the groups comprising the systems of alliances that dominated, to certain 
degrees, an ancient industrial complex of military and protectionist campaigns, waged by 
groups of different backgrounds, structured into armies and other organizations for common 
purposes, intended by the pinnacle of Ancient Roman government to always revolve around their 
good of Ancient Rome. Within these terms contain meanings of alliances forged for practicality, 
all the while retaining a difference by use of barriers of sorts, "foe", "phoi" as possibly 
foil, and "symma" as possibly simulate and/or symmetry, in other words, mocking, imitating, 
in the image for, and be a rightful balance with. The terms are Ancient Roman-centric. However, 
their significance can be reconfigured to terms not of nationalist or imperialist affiliation. 
Alliances. The perceptible forms of what they meant back then during Ancient Rome and what they are 
meaning in the context of today, the earlier half of the 21st century, are surely different. This 
happens to be so due in great part to long-range communications technology. Efforts from sentient will 
go toward implementing systems of alliances, and the principles pertaining to these systems are 
artificial axioms, first and foremost. The means may be different today. For example, the artificial 
axiom of "common courtesy" takes effect by use of artificial axiom subtypes such as "conduct common 
courtesy over long-range communications application". Axioms of natural law cannot be altered through 
the course of time. The progress that has occurred within the last two thousand years may just be 
progress strictly of forms and utility, partially due to greater understanding of axioms of natural 
law. Questions posed against the value of development, the constructionist aspect of progress, are 
convincing enough when they make mention of this truth underneath: axioms of natural law cannot 
change in existence but in effecting phenomena. So there are phenomena and existences of forms 
that become input for perception, and perception recognizes, in belief, eventualities and certainties 
that are to be. Processes to recognize particular phenomena as "human conflict" are themselves part 
of the problem. A starving man is different from both a broken man and a decapitated man, for one. The 
acclimation property of self-interest in the context of economic wrongdoings, specifically that of 
finances and resources, possibly complicated in understanding by discrepancies in informatic 
representation, is why valuation systems serve dual purposes, one being silent killers or at least, 
silent strikers before the easy kill. Studies of Ancient Roman geopolitics offer a questionable but 
valuable lesson: in some circumstances, allies that are not inward offendors have more social and 
political value than friends that cannot let go. The physical peace that economies, alongside such 
things as civics, usher into human societies and prolong is difficult to gauge outside of empirical 
measures that include production, trade, and occupation. This difficulty has to do with the subjectivity 
in judging human behavior and co-existing with human cultures. And the acclimation property of 
self-interest implies a few prevailing truths in the economic context. Circumstances could always get 
worse; these circumstances could get worse for one if one were to "break rank" from their duties. 
Another truth is that if one cannot find happiness in living in their present rife with underachievement 
and inadequacy, then there is no reason except for the spirit for why any endeavor would be able 
to solve those issues. On this second truth, the consequences of specific endeavors are related to the 
individual's involvement in various spheres of influences. A second statement on this truth is 
that boredom is a sin, primarily because the state of existence is in mismatch with the motivation, 
although variably comparable with sins of pro-action when those efforts can be misguided for some 
long-running scheme of malice. Ancient Rome, as with many imperial entities, saw systems of alliances 
as solutions for various problems, obviously, and one category of problems is the seeing eye to eye 
with an other. People from many walks of life co-existed in the power structure of Ancient Rome, 
and undoubtedly disputed with one another in contexts of familial politics, tribal affiliation, and 
commerce. Systems of alliances pre-occupied the subjects and vassals of Ancient Rome, and must 
have been implemented with intention from both subject and ruler to not have to see eye to eye with 
those personally viewed as despicable. The statement is a reasonable hypothesis for supposing the 
longevity of Ancient Rome, from republic to empire to supplantation by its eastern sibling. The 
recorded and narrated activities of Ancient Rome provide exemplification for how the force of self-interest 
operates when there are many individuals, each with their own self-interest. The group image of 
individuals that share in a common cause takes precedence in the breadth of history, and if that group 
image bears enough influence, those individuals may find themselves greatly benefitted by representative 
democracies. Whereas Ancient Rome certainly had phenomena recognized as issues, such as slavery and unstable 
governments by rapid shifts from emperor to emperor, the Ottoman Empire also had its fair share of 
issues: its bureaucracy became inefficient from managing vast territories, having to convert and 
employ the children of the peoples it defeated during its expansion. One issue with discussions 
on problems that plagued expansionist states is that their problems are virtually identical in comparison 
of innermost principle. Political rule as a solution for diversified individual identities, such that 
attempts to centralize can result in repression of the individual, and also, inefficiency due to 
connections weakened by the obligations of the political over those they assume are constantly their 
subjects. The means that human beings take to coalesce into organizations as official as the nation-state 
and the state are important in understanding how empire, as a concept, cannot be comparatively equal in 
practice, although since human beings think, decide, and act mainly by use of artificial axioms rather than 
unthinking impulse, and these artificial axioms frequently lead to instantiating the same axioms of natural 
law, the commonalities that plague empires are quite evident by the resource constraints, resource 
distribution problems, and recognition of political authority, that which plays pivotal roles in 
determining what artificial axioms specific human beings are granted. Human connection is not innately 
integrationist, and this is not always due to self-interest being averted to continual growth of connecting 
with different human beings. The gains of some victories are easier to elongate in duration than those of 
other kinds of victories. A victory by those of legacy continues the legacy, and before that victory, 
there is typically a pronounced degree of support for the legacy in battling the issues. A victory 
achieved by alien or unfair means is always assumed, to some extent, to be received with contempt 
from the originals that have lost in the new game. And the newcomer is naturally forced to have to 
excel in ways unlike their immediate predecessor to compensate for the resistance they face. Perhaps 
the idea of a world definition-less, by default, with respect to some matters is the closest thing 
self-interest can take as truth to combat those biases. This could mean assuming nothing about another 
without personal experience with them, believing that there is no political or cultural structure at 
play that demands cooperation from the individual, and ultimately, not falling into the behaviorial 
trap of relying on generalities, first and foremost, to act in the way of specifics (bottom-up instead 
of top-down). What a world this could be, to be able to let go of those notions that are more than 
half-truths, by empirical measures, because operating by metaphorically leaping off of 
those notions would sometimes skew towards the results that enforce what is to be by what occurred. 
Any individual's self-interest has economical problems to solve, and the power of the "common cause" 
that is organized into shared objective by many human beings is a typical route for letting go of 
differences. This is practical, but its longevity is centered around the practice of the stated 
common cause. Objectives tend to be required to be short-termed rather than long-termed, since the 
results are in demand, time is critical, and the results have to mean something satisfying for those 
that are in need of the results. Common causes elevate the priority of labor and performance in 
coalition, and surely, there must be more outside of every common cause shared by different peoples 
in order for those alliances of perceptible positive meaning to persist. Any honest one can realize 
this by studying the frequent relation between individuals' occupations and their heritage. When the 
economy fails the individual, or perhaps the individual is a failure in their region's economy, the 
individual still has heritage or something; this is a partial thesis on why immigrant groups tend 
to organize in their new host country by something along the lines of their original heritage, for 
there was the shared common cause for their specific suffering that united them to such lengths as to 
convince them to settle in lands elsewhere. There are arguments that posit self-interest as a force 
that can be understood purely in terms of external and perceptible effects. And so long as self-interest 
is pre-occupied, and content with that way of existing in its host, motivation need not be observed except 
out of question by an other.

## More on philosophies of self-interest #64 

The relation between self-interest and information is indeed complicated. This complication is 
a consequence of self-interest having to be economical due to its not being self-contained. The 
principles required to be harnessed in ways of precision for wanted products of effects are 
variable in difficulty of understanding. And the styles of expressing these principles to be 
understood by human beings are also variable. So the starting point consists of principles to be 
known, and the principles do not have to be expressed by human beings in forms accurate and simple. 
Also, there is no universal rule that an arbitrary principle need be understood by a human being; this 
alone is part of the explanation for the consequentialist ways that human societies operate by. 
If information is an asset, and it is especially when recorded into perceptible forms, then 
the knowledgeable human being is one of the closest entities next to information. The 21st 
century trend of monetizing on information is actually nothing groundbreaking, in principle. 
Greater speed of access to and transmission of information through the medium of the Internet 
has allowed informatic activity to be easier monetized, since these activities are conducted 
over programmed self-logging and distributive data services. Calling the greater capabilities 
of storing and operating information more conducive towards disruption is, however, a 
faulty leap in logic. Information is not exempt from the acclimation property of self-interest, 
and it is foolish to forget that although there have been recent events such as the Arab Spring 
(2010), explained as a consequence and promotion of Internet utility, and diversification of 
media sources, these events of grandeur, greatness, and unexpectations are because of the 
will that propels all of self-interest to what has occurred and still stands as a result. Only 
the form has indisputably changed, and the novelty of Internet innovation that initially 
shocked incumbent politics and establishment business seems to have fizzled down to degrees very 
manageable by them. The knowledge of principle is a prime component to alter the pre-determined. 
In the physical and quantitative worlds, the most relevant of these principles are axioms of natural 
law. The systems that human beings have erected are based on principles of levels higher than the 
axiom. The innermost essence of verbal and written expressions is thesis, and thesis does not 
have to pertain to axiom. These two categories of examples are what the instances of self-interest 
plan and strive for. Where there is intention from self-interest, there is no stochastic coincidence 
from sentient life. Such is the wholeness that is true when there is perfect information on perceptible 
chains of events that occurred. The striking appearance loses its luster when the knowledge of its causes 
that were acted out of self-interest, these causes being the principle of relevance for the perceptible 
level, become known. Naivety shrivels away from cognition, and replaced by this state of mind is an 
acceptance self-assured in the belief that the puzzle of understanding has been solved. Thus, one's 
presence in that situation only intends to be entertained without being awed or flabberghasted. And that 
is if the situation is accepted. Otherwise, the events pre-determined for that situation are attempted 
alteration in qualities of disruption and improvement: patterns are broken, variants are created, 
splinters diverge from cause original from self-interest. Innumerable metaphysical layers revolve 
around and are present before the perceptible appearance in forms such as human beings able to 
be interacted with by other human beings. Presumptions are only dangerous when those that believe 
them act on them for causes dangerous in effect to another. There is difficulty in determining how 
terrible a presumptuous thought is. Rather, these thoughts are easier to represent in forms comprehensible 
to human cognition but, then again, human cognition can understand the representational form and 
remain misguided in their comprehension of the represented, all because of their belief of choice. As 
for the term "dangerous" in gauging the harm of a thought, approaches that bear the most convincing 
beliefs on the matter rely on judging the perceptible effects, attributed to the thought, in related 
spatio-temporal contexts. When there needs to be perceptible effect for there to be proof deemed valid, 
one can see why institutions such as the political and legal authorities are not known for their 
foresight or even their hindsight, but for a kind of quasi-scientific application of correspondence 
theory, especially that of corresponding the recorded perceptible effects to the metaphysical concept of 
fault (wrongdoing). This is the typical nature of these institutions, regardless of the specific political 
and religious ideologies of their region of operation. And the reliance on recorded perceptible effects, 
of course, is jeopardized by the risks of fault from responsibilities for record and representation given 
to cognition, especially that of sentient life. Shortfalls from this truth can be solved by the 
actualization of a "permanent good". Both meritocratic pathways and character-building campaigns are 
or become imperfect by contra-action as well as in-action. So it should come as no surprise to any one, 
regardless of their being a "modern person", that a predominant degree of rule through institutions of 
political and legal authority has been done by aristocracy, the bloodline, nobility, per se, in order 
for phenomena of "business as usual" and unity through anti-competition to proceed. To elaborate more 
on this by use of a category of evident counter-examples, the transformation of certain regions in the 
Eastern Hemisphere from aristocracies to communist states in the 20th century resulted in an abnormal 
degree of violence, in great part because the concept of "good as merit" and institutionalized elitism 
were questioned and pitted against what was believed to be essential for moving forth. A controversial 
statement is that integration of human beings and their utility of talents are never ideal in the process 
of actualization, but it is just that some peoples decided to support initiatives that imperiled them to 
the extent of their lives being cut short, rather than live according to withering means under the mercy 
of titles rather than honor. As example to understand how outlandish the ideological concept is attempted 
in actualization through the progressive span of time, imagine some of the descendants of those communist 
insurgents today being aristocrats in their own right, their forefathers' responsibilities of wealth 
management passed on to them as wealth greater than the average of their peers, them sitting around 
casually sipping Parisian wines conversing with those that are descended from their forefathers' mortal 
enemies, laughing and smiling like there is no tomorrow, saying "here is to new beginnings" in all kinds 
of fancy and elegant languages. A humorous remark on the ideological concept is that something about it 
is very roundabout: a human being, out of their self-interest, decides to subscribe themself to an 
ideology, an intangible representational manifestation of the ideal, then they act, and then their 
actions are judged by the parameters set by the implementation of this intangible representational 
manifestation. An essence of fault in ideology is that the labeling system cannot change as quickly 
as specific movement. But in the informatic representation, a sizable portion of the matters of 
information, the generalities are thesis and are preferentially used, instead of plots centering 
around specific individuals alongside universals such as the Seven Deadly Sins and innocence, 
to distinguish groups of human population. An application of the bias-complexity tradeoff, reinforced 
by the will that leads to self-interests that cannot conduct meaningfully bonding communication and 
fair exchange. There exists no universal relation between information and the spatiotemporal freedoms 
given to self-interest. Information is an asset, and intellect is a gift for self-interest. In 
the first exists the potential to exchange, apply, and produce the asset, and is by no means a 
guarantee of anything past the point of its existence. Societal utility places expectations different 
for different cultures. It is noteworthy to mention three cultural categories of intellect, the foremost 
utilizer of information: Greek, Egyptian, and Chinese. This next generalization of these three 
categories will disservice the nuances of the whole truth, but it is a credible way of understanding 
cultural differences in utility of information. Greek culture emphasizes the intellectual pursuit to 
value the as-is quality of information, and is arguably conducive towards the largest spans of 
personal freedoms granted to every intellectual. The Egyptians view information as vital only so far 
as for application; this is seen in their relatively Philistine culture and technological constructs, 
characteristically, the pyramids. And the Chinese view information as closely tied to intellect in 
the sense of the institution of education: be subservient to the instructor, study hard, and apply 
the knowledge acquired for bureaucracy of public familial good. In these characterizations, the 
informed Chinese can be dangerous because they are institutionally obedient, the Greek can be dangerous 
because they harness their wits buttressed by their being exposed to relevant information, and the 
Egyptian can be dangerous because of their relatively instantaneous correlation between information 
and potential material application of arguably greed and display of power. Understanding artificial 
axioms of principle obviously bears effects different than by obeying them. Self-interest has the 
power to produce information through expression, and this force also has responsibilities of varying 
degrees to guard certain information. Expression, elements that are projected outward in ways 
spanning from quasi-true representation of what is and/or was to novelty, is inevitably placed into 
consequentialist spheres of influence. When the expression of what is immediately recognizable 
is discarded as superfluous, there is greater freedom to narrate on it for wanted belief from 
reception. Expression after the fact, as imitation and/or competitive variant to the product related 
to that fact, probably produces conflicts of interest based on the degree of its intrusive 
excess. Expression can be reasoned to be disruptive because its essence is forced to reckon with 
what already is and, in turn, have questions cast on it serving motives outside of the agreement that 
does not require any more words than what is vital for the objective; this reasoning is an 
example of why reason that turns into that for intended effect is actually command by reason. 
There is the saying "silence is gold", and gold is less alive than it is dead.

The media serves as the foremost primary category to distinguish and connect elements that exist 
in the same world. Media is for the ends that rely on it, and is itself an ends for certain 
objectives. Without the media, representation would not be able to be known, so realization of 
objectives that concern representation is cut short. Every self-aware entity would be disjoint from 
the remaining whole, existing in accordance with their lone bodily and cognitive mechanisms, and with 
no capability to interact with the external. Inanimate objects would not be able to be transferred 
from point to different point. The world would be fixed in place, and sentience be of little 
significance alongside the inanimate. This then makes for phenomena most convincing of being 
pre-determined, the complications from potential streamlined into deterministic processes known 
before they occur, so that after the occurrence is the supporting proof of the argument, which turned 
out not to be an argument against any plausible counter but a wholesome truth expressed on the actual. 
By default, self-interest has as much demand for control as it does for the understanding. And in 
fact, the two concepts are greatly intertwined with one another, in which control acquired through 
the unintended coincidence could grant the base for furthering understanding, and actions from 
understanding for the topic of that understanding actualizes into something much more pronounced 
in effect, due to the economy of absolute effort concentrated into the one route, lessening the 
chances for collateral messiness. The evolution of forms for media, as well as the constant 
of ever-subjective labeling schematics for what are media and ends, due to context-switching, 
are some of the reasons for the validity of the assumption of lack of expectations. The ends 
encompass the span for a whole, and this whole can be known to certain depths. But in between, 
there are infinitessimal essences that drive derivation of a source form into different forms, 
and also liabilities of transmission between the ends that are usually more fixed than the in-between. 
Consider gravity, one of the axioms of natural law. Discoveries of gravity did not take place in 
a vacuum, for there would be none. Neither were the discoveries reached by internally contemplating 
on the many universals, via combinatorial processes of rational-like representation of emotions and 
emotions as feedback on reason. Planet Earth was how human beings back then personally discovered 
gravity, and it still serves as the central source for human beings' personal discoveries of gravity 
today. Planet Earth's relatively constant existence gives cognition a base of reasoning about gravity, 
one of the axioms of natural law. Gravity is not just an abstract concept, but something very real, 
technically understood to the extent of scientific formulae that predicts the gravitional pull from the 
planet on objects both falling towards and resting on it. Cognition, in tasks that do not solely focus 
on the force of gravity, could instead equate gravity with planet Earth and still generate thoughts 
of quality acceptable enough for actions to take place for the intended effects. Equations that 
balance non-null differences between the two ends are a high frequency in cognitive tasks. For the 
mathematician that requires concentration, they would be wise to practice a neglect of the applications 
of equations on matters outside of their immediate field, matters that intersect with other fields, 
since the equations in social matters, especially, seldom remain singularly objective for long. And 
even if singularly objective, the equation could not be more important than the prospects for making 
dues on top of that equation. Why would self-interest turn into a static force upon the social arrivals 
of equations in relation to its host? In the same vein that planet Earth can be equated with the force 
of gravity, man and woman alike have always sought to be equated with some ways. The most fundamental 
cause for this desire to seek the representative position is that since man and woman are both human 
beings, this cause is that human beings are bound to be "political animals" in their interactions with 
one another, with regards to their expectations and the actual of others' expectations. Human beings 
will never be able to control phenomena to an absolute degree. This statement is obvious enough to 
acknowledge; axioms of natural law are not bound to sentient action or belief for their existence. 
Thus, the concept of pre-determinism, for human beings, for any being with their self-interest, 
can be objectively discussed only by the information known of fact and principle. This truth then 
encourages the sentient desire to understand and control the media; cliche, yes. And the statements 
made on the facts and that of principle need to satisfy one main area to be believable: the effects 
that may, in turn, be the ends for some objective. The middle agent is perhaps the most important 
category in environments with entities that are not self-sufficient in some way. Phenomena of one 
nation-state being economically coupled to another provides the most easily comprehensible examples 
of the relevance of middle agents, they with their designated roles in transportation, marketing, 
and distribution regarded in the same vein in their area of operation as the foreign producers 
themselves. When there is material sufficiency, the desire to politick is elevated to the forefront 
of priorities, labeled under the umbrella terms, "defense" and "order", and with this desire is 
followed up by demands to control the representation through the media, the representation being 
that of intended outermost appearance with intentions behind its design possibly extending all the way 
down to the depths of personal interpretation. The media is that important to some for them to view it as 
an ends itself. Then the media slants to becoming the source of focus to direct the ends. The artificial 
axioms that self-interest employs to direct sentient decision-making are applied to the material world, 
and the hosts of self-interest in a busy world, structured for its members to continue on in ways 
designated explicitly or implicitly, are in the metaphorical spotlight, positions prime to being 
recognized as representatives of "practice" and "ideal" alike, these two embodied by the host of 
self-interest. The media has conservative qualities associated with it, despite the political 
leanings in the context of socio-political media. There are the ends that need to be preserved in 
most cases, except for ones such as those involving projectiles. Currency is an example of the 
efficiency that human beings have aimed for in their interactions of material and socio-political 
gains or losses. Currency typically weighs less than the material exchanged for it, and cannot be 
qualitatively compared with services that are compensated with currency, in the direct sense. Yet, 
in ordered societies, the official economy operates by currency rather than arbitrary barter. Currency 
is a medium that represents the value of all products and services of value, and the power above it 
that is the terms of the valuation market is the base of support for the continuation of the currency, 
the medium for the ends of value through exchange and possession. Perhaps this is one of the reasons 
why the possession or control of currency cannot guarantee the "will of the people"; however, the 
"will of the people" is a topic outside the confines of this discussion on media. There is a 
subcategory where currency is relevant that is a little puzzling, perhaps pathological as well, 
to think on. The medium of currency is designed to be exchanged, typically between at least two 
consenting parties. And with that purpose, currency is supposed to compensate for effected ends of 
the past and in store. How can currency compensate those that have experienced those things against 
their will, now monetarily valued by the currency? A great deal of a factor on the usage of currency 
is the exchange should be agreed on by the two ends of sender and receiver. But that is the ideal 
case. In practice, as already stated, currency is powered by the terms of the valuation 
market, and this representation of value, as inanimate as it is, is beholden to the powers above 
it, in which human beings from many walks of life can contribute their judgments and proclivities 
towards its practice, demonstrated by stock market activity. The concept of "capitalism" has 
vulnerabilities in the sense of the previous statement, evident when the practice of values becomes 
much fixated on the monetary aspect, so much that concerns have been raised every so often on 
these practices of inaccuracy that then gives credence to the base constructs of socialism and 
aristocracy, both guaranteeing stability to certain degrees, and differing in the sense of the 
state and the familial-based society being the anti-source for unwanted change. And what is really 
guaranteed, regardless of circumstances, from these alternative routes outside of capitalist 
valuation systems without the "will of the people" also somehow having to be pre-occupied with 
the corrections and maintenance that need to continually occur? Ridiculous, really, for things to 
be so set into place, metaphorically seeping into the blood and brains for the spirit of a people, 
and then the matters concerning human beings and their societies labeled as capitalist, socialist, 
all under umbrellas of some combinatorial fusing of the state and familial bloodline, forever a zone 
so gray the zone spurs demand for human expertise, from the services economy, to clarify on the 
ambiguities of the media and the ends at play. The truths from the many pathways of complex chains 
of events and also the reasoning and defaults for those occurrences are all comparable with one another, 
that is for sure. The media pertains to self-interest, in the contexts that the hosts of self-interest 
exist and operate in, all the way down to the oxygen required to sustain most of sentient life. 
A rich irony that is in need of being stated, in conclusion, is that the more control is applied onto 
the media, the less expansion and divergence for the changes wanted by the ends, and the furthering 
of these limitations are a cause for possible deterioration of the media in between the ends that just 
does not know how to satisfy any end, the balance that the media must be. And that is probably why the 
ends are never the eternal or heaven for the human being in life, especially if a human being is an 
end, thinking and acting for their self-interest but from the will. 

## More on philosophies of self-interest #66 

With utility of the media by choice qualities, there is economy dedicated towards interacting with 
the related ends. Phenomena of connectivity, partially as designed effect from human beings, poses 
questions on what the idiom of "mind your own business" really means. A definitive trait of 
self-interest, a force that is not self-contained for any of its hosts, is reflected in quality 
onto the media of human design and function, with specific purposes that are always related to 
improvement and efficiency of form. Media of human design bears the effect of demanding its usage 
by human beings. Products designed by human beings are placed onto the metaphorical table of choice 
for objective. It is true that for every product made to act as the answer for an objective, many 
more competing products failed to reach or surpass the frequency of use for that product. All the 
same, media is the one categorical class that enables one sentient being to relate to another. The 
demand of media designed by human beings, those demanded as nutrients for human beings, and even 
the thoughts intentionally thought of by human beings for conclusions of sentiment and reason are 
all pertinent, "alive" in cognition of experiential sensation and perception, primarily when 
frequency of occurrence is not null. The choice of human beings to think and act in however ways 
they want becomes limited not only by their spatiotemporal circumstances, but also by the products 
that emerge as the common way, perhaps from artificial axioms that have bested others to suit certain 
objectives. Human languages are unifying ways of verbal and written expression, since communication 
that cannot deliver meaning past the immediate sound or image fails the objectivity sought 
for in language. The tools that human beings use, the decorum of attire and formalities, amongst 
other aspects are examples of the need for objectivity through decision in media form of choice. And in 
cases of differing styles and differing products, there is usually a reference that is competed 
against, and most definitely an original that splintered into these variants. Quality alone is 
insufficient for the human being, one with their self-interest networked with other human beings 
and their self-interests. There is quality and then there is acceptance that is required, in that 
order, for one product to be preferred over another product with regards to the same objective. 
For the same objective, there are varying forms, known and unknown in either design or principle of 
axiom of natural law by human beings, that produce their corresponding intended solutions of possibly 
differing qualities. The concept of the "free market" is the most prominent of human beings' ideological 
conceptions that is for the purposes of promoting improvement in product and enlarging the span of choice, 
albeit these two purposes cannot fully capture the demand when the demand and the capital are distances 
apart. On the last clause of this previous statement, the clause is relevant as cause only when 
there is actual merit from the product, for products that are more in line with artistic style and 
scientific design are subject to the judgment of human subjectivity. Such is the futility of human 
preference, really it is bias, that is argued and advocated for as cause when the effects are 
predicted to guarantee livelihood in the preferred way, stuck in the ways of the form with aversion to 
belief in being proven wrong except for events that relate to the axiom of natural law, namely, the 
terminal ends of severance, defeat, and fatality. More needs to be written on this, since surely 
there are notions of the demand for battle and war as solution. The monopolist and the autocrat 
know all too well that "battle" and "war" outcomes rest on the economy of support for these phenomena, 
and additionally on particular movements honestly recognized as stochastic only when the pertaining human 
beings could not account for them beforehand. The famous Chinese general Sun Tzu stated "victory is 
won before the war", a wisdom on the merit of preparatory power and the limitations on possibilities 
that could transpire from the initial base. For all the faults of pre-determinism, the helplessness on 
top of the possible knowledge, the realities of influence and scale are pivotal determinants. The 
monopolist crushes his competitors because his media overshadows their work and darkens their competitive 
idealism into the abyss of obsolescence. The autocrat does not bear direct witness to most errors from the 
wars he declared, and must think himself to be the last in his reign to possibly perish. In both of these 
cases, the preference has been set to a modality amenable to those predominantly in charge and thus, 
the objective of ruling takes precedence before any product or competitor of merit in quality, and this 
fact points to the systemic connectivity of media matters for simulating objectivity where there is none 
by default base. The thought and labor of business is superior to that of war because war is a 
consequence of the deterioration of viability in civil business, a negatively insane child as a result 
of an unscrupulous parent, per se. Leaders are not the only ones responsible for media of material 
or immaterial product. The fixation on utility of accepted form, this being the manifestation of media 
design in most frequent use, is from the populace as well. As easily as meritocratic systems, reliant on 
certain media to deliver objective results to distinguish one member from another, can crumble from flukes 
and favoritism, the choice utility of any media is choice into decision because of the sidedness being at 
least two and the entry points for deliverance to the end/s numbered at least one. "Aiming high" and 
"hitting low" are two routes of effects from the one intention to satisfy the objective. The dominating 
media of use in activities of service especially, rather than direct product, evolve. Self-interest 
operates by fundamentals including those of introspection, reflection, expression, and individuation, and 
for its host to relate to another sentient being, there is media of permanence and that for the temporal 
service, completely reliant on the motivation that is a dependency for the will which is, in turn, 
a dependency for self-interest. There is nothing but scale and influence, absolutely nothing in relation 
without media, that is a deterrent to the proliferation of actualized improvements and degenerations 
alike. It is typically more healthy to privately assume the media is a tool rather than a master, for 
the sake of sanity for the individual. What travels through the media is subject at least to the media. 
There is no universal axiom of natural law that states media must be introspective, reflective, expressive, 
or individuative because of these two causes, the intentions from self-interest and the all-encompassing 
contextual application of the term "media". A human being can be a medium as much as inanimate objects 
and ephemeral words spoken are. Contexts change and social networks of human beings organize into different 
chains of command and delivery, so that even for the same object considered the media, the ends of 
that media may be subject to what has come to them and still have the confidence to believe themselves 
to be objective in judgment. This is where accountability is complicated in great part because of 
inabilities to agree on quantification schemes so that where there is question, there needs to be human 
opinion, just as where there is demand to attribute responsibility, one or more of the ends as well as 
the existence of the media in its form of features and design must be the one/s that bear the burden. 

## More on philosophies of self-interest #67 

Some of the statements made in elaboration on the concept of the media, in sections 65 and 66, 
are certainly dubious due to the multi-interpretative routes. Simply, who is to say "black" is 
not "black" but "white" when hue is not the central topic? Consider the statement made, in 
section 65, on the initiative of politicking being elevated to the forefront when there is material 
sufficiency. The statement's use of the term "politick" is reserved for the thought and procedures 
organized around developed social ideas and executed to enable rule. Someone that is not "materially 
sufficient" naturally has to produce or look for products to satisfy the most basic of necessities 
so that living is extended. The phrase "materially sufficient" cannot be entirely objective. The 
proclivities of each individual human being, effects from their passions, seldom lead to wants 
singular and streamlined. It is not enough to have a sufficient diet for most people. It is also 
not enough to own enough. Material sufficiency is satisfied by these two statements, yet the human 
being strives for something more. And here is where the human being is most at ease, their 
biological functions not having to beg out of deprivation, to politick. Of course it can be said that 
human beings, out of material insufficiency, also become driven to politick. But in these cases, the 
politicking cannot be prime to rule. Starvation needs to be satisfied, and those on the brink of death 
from malnutrition cannot be expected to want anything more than the material, at first. So these two 
categories of human beings wishing to politick, after achieving material sufficiency or to achieve 
material sufficiency, are different by the qualities of the former desiring to enhance or stabilize 
their societal paradigm and the other desiring to construct new societal paradigms. This is quite 
basic and does not capture the curious cases of individuals that are materially sufficient yet do 
not know how to be at ease with this material sufficiency. Complaints about the bourgeois class 
frequently mention this incongruency between material sufficiency and spiritual emptiness: something 
just is not quite right even with such things as adequate monetary income. There must be a lack of 
application in these cases, for all the glories and glamours that the archetype Parisian Civilisatrice 
had to offer, the man of good honor and good faith died in vain, having never hurt a fly or spoken a dirty 
lie, by being entangled and smothered in culture. It is necessary to apply questions onto the political 
that think they are "materially insufficient". How can one that is "materially insufficient" be in the 
position to construct new societal paradigms that do not revolve around just that, the material, and the 
remainder of their successes dedicated to depravity? The same can be asked of the "materially 
sufficient", since that is just how politics works: inspections fastidious, bordering on pathological 
if not pathologically full of falsehoods, of the political individual and/or organization. But 
on the category of the "materially insufficient", the historical lengths of their insufficiency surely 
has made them experience matters below the norm, such that there is surely a strong chance they cannot 
recognize quality when they see it. And that is precisely why the stupid and the smart, the noble and 
ignoble, and other dichotomous types are given the opportunity to be political representatives. 
The great number of pathways of execution and power in networked social systems would actually be 
disserviced by practicing these kinds of exclusions to pronounced degrees. The truth of the application 
of these categorical labels may be acquired through accurate and calculative judgment, but where there 
is agenda, there is cause of desired gain through imposed advantages and disadvantages that serves as 
reason. Also, the zero-sum nature of terrible political decisions actually demands certain members of 
certain factions to be operationally incompetent in order to provide convenient pathways for their 
opposition. The goal for one to "mind their own business" is really about their being devoid of 
mindfulness on matters outside of their immediate goals and surroundings. Connectivity enabled by 
media forms is considered less, de-prioritized in pursuit of the passion. It would be a cognitive 
drain, an economic mismanagement, for those solely dedicated to their own "business" to focus on 
those matters outside of the pursuit. One's unconsiderate regard for matters not related to their 
"business" can only guarantee their focus for their "business", but their ignorance of the characteristic 
connectivities pertaining to their business that then results in their going out of "business" 
is partly their responsibility. The media, something ambivalent, something that cannot be anticipated 
fully on the specific instances of its utility, usually is fixated for purposes clear enough in 
its users' beliefs. The media transfers energy and transforms the specifics of the work. A rich 
man's wealth in the form of companies and influence does his work for him. And he seldom minds 
when his only possible sin is that of wrongdoing his wealth is in support of. Who is friend or 
foe in relation to the media? The media that can be wielded by a foe is an extension of the foe's 
intended malice. The media that is an extensive social network, on the other hand, is clearly more 
tricky to determine the qualities of alliances. The force of self-interest conducts itself 
primarily by intention, but this intention is sometimes superceded by the uncontrollable effects 
in cognition's rankings of relevance. An action done by a friend that damages another, therefore 
antagonistic to that other's self-interest, that is then attributed by that other to the friend 
could possibly shatter the friendship. The reasoning: the effect was malicious. However, the cause 
may not have been. A parallel description can be made on an action done by an enemy that enables 
another. The media expands the surface of interpretation on its users. Its users are associated with 
the extra class of variables that represent that media. The task of attribution involves solving 
the sub-problem of differentiating between the media and the user. Through the media, the pragmatic 
of forging alliances with historical enemies is realized and furthermore, these becomings are 
understood adequately enough for handling by knowing the predicted outcomes of ends and the media's 
usage patterns. The media can also act as a demotivator to change: it projects the image of freedom 
to use it for objectives borne out of self-interest, yet the themes of these objectives are seldom 
novel in comparative analysis through the span of time. So the objectives do not radically change 
despite the changes of the media's forms. And the intention from self-interest to change the form of 
the media is categorically scientific. Every relevant media that human beings have designed followed 
the classic usage pattern of the upside-down V. When the usage changes and sours with the emergence 
of alternatives, the media is supplanted by superior or more affluent designs, and one could objectively 
state that that is time-agnostic progress. When the changes of usage are quite simply shifts in 
objectives, however, that are actually not very original in the thematic comparison, then the first 
impression of the motives of that context are the applications surrounding those motives, so that the 
progress of revising or developing improved forms from that media form are not as recognized. A last 
note of question on this for example, how can it be a universal rule to mourn a middle agent that 
passed away when it was always their profit for their self-interest in their waking life? Well, 
that would be the artificial axiom to mourn from the cause of that being the socially acceptable 
thing to do.

## More on philosophies of self-interest #68 

The media allows for strategy to proceed and reconfiguration to other possible forms. Perhaps the 
only relevant interactions one sentient being has with another are those actions by pre-defined 
features, many of which are not naturally occurring, of the media through the media. There is not 
a direct correlation between the controllability of a particular media and the magnitude of human design 
that was used to produce that media. The media of default that has enabled human existence on Planet 
Earth is the starting point for the constructing by human beings of any media, that is, these categories 
of media would not have existed if not for the willful endeavors from sentience that greatly depended 
on a certain degree of mastery over any related axiom of natural law. The term "artificial", as used 
to denote the concept of the "artificial axiom", is used to differentiate that from without the input 
of sentient decision-making and effort. A great deal of strategy surrounds media in contexts 
concerning human beings. The decision to use one media form over another for the same objective is an 
example of human-to-human differentiation. Achievements in constructing newer forms of media have 
connotations of competition associated with them, the replacement of one media over another 
characteristic of gradualism, how the form and its associated methodologies can only be phased out 
and still not without resistance from proponents of the predecessor. Examples in the category of 
"media" allow for relations that would never have occurred, amplification and further projection of 
some default strength, and comprehension of a particular what-is that depends on interpretation 
through media instead of by direct observation on that what-is. So the decisions that have been 
made and continue to be made on media utility constitute a significant part of human strategy to 
co-exist and assert with one another. The preferences in language, although ephemeral in speech and 
dependent on interpretation in writing, are a differentiator between peoples, and the utility of any 
language serves to differentiate the matters of the implicit in the what-is and to concentrate meaning 
into aims of objective, and additionally is the most frequent tool used in deception, at least serving as 
the initial element in any deceptive chain of events. A class of phenomena that is peculiar to note, 
if not for the consideration of the traits pertaining to the sentient agents, is one group of 
human beings viewing some media form for granted while others marvel at it as if it were something 
closer to a higher power than what it is in origin, below man such that man has the power to make or 
break it after the proliferation of its production methodology has satisfied a threshold. One 
misconception is what is below in the metaphysical ranking is closer to the physical zero, so it 
is inconsequential. The abundance of raw material oftentimes takes priority over the idea, so must 
then be of greater concern than the conception of idea. Development demands cognitive functions critical 
of this base, the raw material, and propagates competition in forms extending beyond material ownership. 
The factor of competition becoming decentralized away from a singular objective, most recognizable when 
the objective is associated with object, is cause for additional problems that networked sentient beings 
such as humans have to contend with. Then the notion of the development and improvement of conception from 
the idea is regarded as not that important when the source, the raw material, is already there should the 
time come for appropriate use, but that would first require the drive to develop. Some call the decision to 
uphold this notion exemplary of complacency, others of modesty, and the evidence for the superiority of 
form development becomes subjective in the lens of preferred styles and initiatives, even when objective 
measures capture the inequality. The idea is the easiest for self-interest to intentionally transmit 
although may be difficult to be understood, and those ideas novel in relativity to the recipient and 
prime for constructive application are the most difficult to accept for the scope of use, since the 
informed decision to believe in such things must have taken into consideration the "whole" of the 
construct that it is supposed to materialize in; deconstructive processes are necessary to make 
room in the same space that is the "whole". The field of commerce provides a sufficient area of 
discussion on priorities with respect to development. When the means to acquire is markedly easier, 
cheaper in monetary terms, than the means to produce, the centrality for the product's existence 
is kept constrained and regulated, thus elevating source rarity for the product as a significant 
variable in its valuation; this statement is the basic premise that states and companies alike seek 
to control. The consistency in the magnitude of ease for the means of acquisition is a crucial part 
of conserving social constructs. Artificial axioms becoming heavily geared towards solving for 
the decision junctions required in matters concerning the product. Ways of life were established 
and then are upheld. Stability and order become fixtures, and ideas accepted are those primarily for 
entertainment outside of the social centrality around the product. These previous statements 
partly constitute a conceptual thesis for why monopolies in production and distribution are formed. 
The dividing line between high technology production and raw material production is indeed 
predominantly economy by region, and for most intents and purposes, an arbitrary society probably 
can not afford to divest its cognition from one side in this division to another, out of the 
lack of support through dependency via socio-political connection. The will of a people becomes 
streamlined for the cause of effecting product in mass. Reason is constrained to these ends, and 
it is not until these pre-set ways of living are tested past the point of acceptable adversity 
that the foundation for objectives in production are questioned enough for possible reform. For 
all the prestige associated with careers of services, the factor of monotony remains an underlying 
possibility. Movement is the basis for change and requires energy of form different from the 
root step, that of no movement. The concept of "movement" does prove to be quite challenging to 
handle as a task when the practice is not in line with the constants of effects from decisions based 
around artificial axioms, these of course being set by self-interest. A Pax Status. Harmony and 
peace as effect from constraints in decisions towards pre-set artificial axioms that have been 
agreed upon in consensus of command. Robustness of self-interest to adopt new ways of thinking and 
producing quickly craters under the need to be one with the constant that concerns peers. Most 
societies cannot be robust enough to adapt to certain categories of change, since those social 
networks were formed around common cause. The splintering of common cause into obsolescence forces 
each member to resort back to their self-interest, and motives suppressed for what was once their 
"greater good" unleashed in ways that are seldom different in principle from the others, the 
"barbarians", per se. As such, the empirical recognition of a rapid pace of change mistakenly 
reasons into rapid revisions of common cause, which does sometimes amount to violence not of 
consensus especially when the innermost essence of the "social fabric" for a people is ordered 
function for cause. The topic of gossip is a classic one in the conceptual umbrella of the "media". 
For one, gossip is a social security practice of sorts. If gossip does not uncover the truth, then 
at least there is still the possibility of knowing the chains of transmission concerning that 
gossip, allowing members to note what is pre-eminent in communication from member cognition. Gossip, 
in cases where an other not part of the discussion is discussed, also serves purposes in discovery 
of truths concerning the members of that discussion. This statement is a truth from the consequence 
of self-interest possessing privatization properties, from material to immaterial wants and aversions. 
It is easier to use as examples those that are not part of the discussion, so that conversation about 
them in delicate and intimate aspects do not directly shine relational discomfort onto members of that 
discussion. Furthermore, the proceedings from these arrangements for discourse test at least the 
reactions from revelation and falsities alike, these reactions corresponding to the underlying truths 
that concern the members, not readily able to be known due to choice expression. 

## More on philosophies of self-interest #69 

Media allows for strategy from one end to deliver formulated vectors to another. This is exactly 
why the innermost essence of problems concerning one end are difficult to solve even in the most 
efficiently networked situations via media. Mathematically, this could be presented as a balancing 
issue with the cost-effectiveness possibly being sufficient yet still degenerative over time. But really, 
what is to be said when one of the ends is supposed to be excised out of the equation for the balance, 
seemingly arbitrary, is it not? One instance one end concerning the media really matters, the next not. 
Artificial media clearly is not the endpoint beyond all else, and although it can serve as solution or 
for solution, the decision to use or improve it is not guaranteed, as already stated. The commonality 
in user perception of media is relational. Through the relations of connectivity that allow each to 
participate in the media, in other words, sharing the same space, the status of participant implies 
a kind of equality shared between the users. Thus, each user preference possibly unique is nevertheless 
factored into the workings of this shared media. In the realm of decision-making, there exists 
transformative processes to turn truth or falsity into objective and perhaps fiction into underlying 
truth of principle into cause. Even when the solution is associated with the highest statistical marks 
of quality, the solution for problem may not be the one that fits the problem case; in practices of the 
natural sciences, this is demonstrated very frequently in medical treatment, where the treatment fails the 
benchmark to be categorized as a cure yet is still used only to prolong suffering, or when the "cure" is not 
officially recognized as such because the body of evidence for it is scarce and not from established 
authorities in the field of health, not very surprising since biology is stochastic in the available 
choices of axioms for operating life (permutatorial) and cause of biological life does not entirely 
originate as product from engineering by human beings. The category of efficiency has intersection with 
that of directness: streamlined, concentrated, and uni-directional. Maintenance of confidence in the media 
oftentimes proceeds into its users agreeing on some way of efficiency for use; in the realm of 
communication, this could mean being forthright and honest with a preference for being humorless as opposed 
to producing possible cause for disruption, but because of inevitable differences in matters of 
complication is moreso something like common courtesy. On the concept of freedom, there are many 
examples of media that do not promote greater spans of choice, only greater speed in whatever available 
choices. So there are aims prior to the use of those particular media that remain as aims, heavily 
implicative of the motive remaining the same and only performance along some metrics sought to be 
enhanced. Fostering aversion to objectivity and initiative for some particular human beings is an 
objective itself. Imagine that some matters, once placed into the differentiating realm of problem or 
solution, spark a need for objective from the views of self-interest. And the objective is then acted 
out in ways that must benefit one more than the other in some way. Would not aimlessness as a requirement 
for being a participant in the media be preferred over pre-meditated movement for unwanted change? And 
then "aimlessness" would be synonymized with "freedom": acting in chains of events that are not for any 
singular or known objective, not aware of being beholden to any agenda, not having to make effort for 
purposes constructive to one's application and intrusive into another's domain. A related topic to 
aimlessness in multi-agent contexts is the concept of nonzero sum changes. Now, nonzero sum typically 
requires willful participation of the involved parties through actions that do not invoke zero sum matters 
or collide in interests that may be conceived as gain for one necessitating loss from another. In 
situations of hierarchy, especially the cases where command structure is consequence from the specific 
hierarchy, the assignment of status is a non-null variable in the specifics of actualized wants 
corresponding to the involved agents. Assignment of status could be perceived as zero sum: there are the 
expected and the actual courses of events that serve as two categories of variables for comparative 
measures into gains and losses. A complexity through hierarchy surely does not pre-determine all 
actualizations, but the relativity of status in a connected arrangement of agents is one of those 
categories of variables often used by one to reason about why their expectations were not met, the 
class of belief that a different status would have resulted in the satisfaction of those expectations, 
a different starting point or basis in the geometric sense. The category of media, in its various forms, 
may under-deliver to participants. The relational and connective attributes of media entail some primary 
routes in decision-making as reaction to the available good at the time. To elaborate, good times 
encourage participants of the same media to act in ways benign and in declining times, the connectivity 
dilutes desire into disappointment, sponsors debt into greater debt, and confuses thievery for generosity. 
The media that is maximalized in masking capability and relatively unrestricted in intention for usage is 
utilized by its participants that are confident without guarantee. Consider the challenge of detecting 
deception in this kind of media. The capabilities have already been maximalized so that there are 
virtually no available extensions or revisions to that media that could preserve the identity of function 
for that media, and that particular media is solely designated for use. The truth behind lies is guarded 
by chained defenses, and the relative equality of its members does not permit any member to detect the 
transmitted lie when analysis is constrained entirely to the realm of that media; this is related to the 
theoretics of the cryptographic power behind blockchain technology. Then participants, out of their 
self-interest, may use alternative forms of media in asymmetric fashion to deal with shortcomings of this 
kind of media. In all, there was asymmetry present in the use of this media due to not every possible agent 
being a participant, and asymmetry by participants diverting towards alternative forms to this media as 
solution to its problems.

Oftentimes in life, a belief in the inherent goodness of things is required of one for them to be at 
ease with proceeding forward in however which way. Goodness, relative in relation between some of all 
and preference as one, of a passing threshold is required for the continuing use of any media not 
immediately necessary for prolonging life. Tact of immediacy loses direction to the varying trials 
from the adversary with the constant aims, the strength and speed and vitality lost through fretful 
effort to collapse nonetheless, an example of the necessity of patience. Those that desire to participate 
in a media sacrifice clarity, that is, the notions of non-contradicting relation to one another, for 
relations to the content of that media's objects. Clarity in statement and action does blur the 
recognition of a media with more than one end into a mass of homogenous anatomy. For every variable, 
atomic-like understandings of a media assign each end to an interest. And in any media of relevance, 
there are many variables, and interests born out of self-interest are not fixated to the non-static 
experience. The notion of there being an ideal practice, the practice being not a compensation but 
a necessary realization for the ideal, is but a belief if not for the force of standing up for and 
advancing it. Ideal practices may never be implemented through to the decisive end of all ends in 
cases where the rigidity necessitates limitation, and fear of limitation for defeat becomes already 
present. The belief in the inherent goodness of the media that falls short of optimal performance 
persists out of fear for any alternative of formulation that was already determined to always be 
nullified, as proof of allegiance to the form and function for the ends of that one media to interact 
in. In the train of thought for this belief, experience of sub-optimal conditions are not registered 
in the exponentially negative sense. For the multitude of media variables that did not produce the 
primes at critical points in duration, there is still yet another opportunity, and the self goes ahead 
to other activities and remains confident that the other ends of the media will re-calibrate themselves 
into different execution of the function agreed on at the beginning as the best for the respective test. 
To question the fundamentals of this media the self, being a participant, has already agreed on is 
adversarial to its existence so that events must still proceed with or without error, the objectivity of 
error-recognition however accurate is questionable and may be even dangerous to the fundamental of this 
media's form and function. If the issue was not resolved by now or the activity did not go as planned, 
the demand is still there to stay and not above or alongside, but under. The media is good in belief then, 
because it serves any participant of one end through its existence that ultimately supercedes every end, 
although some ends may very much be in predominating administration of it. What is the body of ideas 
for the media outside of its uses? Those desperate for answers of any form of function worth passing 
grade will have to follow in the image of that one media effector. In these cases, the recognition that 
the effects work is the satisfied metric for merit and the correspondence to ideological purity 
inappropriate for the context. The tendencies of the participants in reacting to the "nature" of the 
media matters they are a part of for the solution of one endeavored by all has already been put into 
motion. Backtrack on what is to be done commanded in real-time or derived from the media fundamental of 
form and function to too far of an extent, perhaps even a second thought, and the innermost essence of 
things have to be metaphorically disintegrated and replaced with an essence that can still move forward 
however. The navigation as the wanted effect and the objective of motion as the wanted essence is superior 
for reaching or meeting checkpoints in experience. Meditation, allocated time expired, for supposed wisdoms 
from this state of cognition are perceived as poetic nonsense fit for circular slumber far removed 
from the pertinence, so must be distanced from. In the media of multi-agent activity, integrity could 
translate into the need for identity-based selflessness, something very subject to the whims of design 
by more than one instance of self-interest; the default identity of a media with multiple participants 
is the whole of them all and functionally contained at that. Identity provides definition, definition 
has meaning, allusion to identity strengthens resistance against doubt, and correspondence to identity 
reaffirms origin that must be good of strength. The force of self-interest would produce thought and 
action as if there were no self responsible for the instance of it if there were no identity at all 
in this mix of media, and if identity of self excluding remainder remains, haphazard in the consideration 
of the rules of artificial or natural axiom. Delicacy in preserving the fitting match between participants 
and media for complex situations is conducive to stasis only because the positive effort is not there to 
displace the jagged complements that form the multi-sourced fusing into whole. The clarity of perceiving 
the whole may be lost, but rediscovery could always proceed as long as it stays whole in the identity of 
original formation. And the clarity of this introspection by a media participant does not have to occur or 
be accurate for there to be motion, driven by self-interest from the self with its motivation to will. So 
sometimes, hard points are driven for closure while questions are spared to remain open. Besides from 
the effects produced by function of media, a balancing question takes effect to demand answers in 
relation to the demands for non-static effect, which would pose difficulties related not merely to 
persistence as in the case of constancy, that demands function of contextually differing effects. The 
route to achieve robustness is through specialization of skill, and this goal effects an individuation 
of identity regardless of the quality of identity at initial point. The ends of the media are placed 
into inconsistent comparisons of identity, quality through quality that is not only for a non-null 
answer but something genuine right down to the innermost essence of any thought or action related 
to this environment. The ends have minds of their own then, and this is more important in the event 
of this kind of individuation that, in turn, produces dependency for the whole to preserve function of 
satisfaction met in robustness. And this becomes a management problem, one that handles doubt as well 
about the delegation of agency to one or more of these ends in the participant environment connected 
by the media. The media that is experienced through participation cannot be observed in full, logic 
on the metaphor of the bird's eye. It must oftentimes be thought that wisdom is not found by memorizing 
words and phrases, and wisdom only through language is by reaching the meaning such that for completeness, 
the origin of spirit and activity through social construct that produced it is also known; observation 
translated into communicated meaning is not necessarily power of observation over the experience without.

The notion of security is attempted translation into fixtures virtually guaranteed to deliver or execute as 
formally declared, which is a sort of business robust in the capabilities of covering or targeting the 
objects and objectives labeled as pertinent, regardless of the designation of it as public or private 
enterprise. It is a damned shame, really, for security to be critical in balance for balance and all the 
while also having to align with political interests, because then, conversations on and implementations of 
security are forever bound to the asymmetry of the protected and the protector, amongst other categories in 
these dynamical systems. Somewhere in the design and execution of security in flux for the wanted stases is 
relation to or output from purely political interests, in other words. It would definitely be easier for 
comprehension if matters are set into stone, from sentience a will-lessness, but that is precisely why words 
unchallenged could be dangerous regardless of the supposed nobility in cause of preference, typically by use 
of artificial axiom justifying the decision as principle very grounded yet from up high and beyond, the 
unattainable ideal if the practice is challenged because the practice is the most ideal in relativity so 
much that it should serve as the pinnacle for standard. Consider the cases of decisions made that are then 
placed under subjective scrutiny. For these decisions, there is a representative that finalizes the output 
from the decision-making process into decision. The representative is called these truths such as "weak" and 
"strong", "high-minded" and "lowly", these dichotomies go on, in the first lines of argument, and the 
substance underneath or surrounding is taken for granted although not all of it is known. And perhaps even 
if all is known, there is still preference not for singularity. There is always some thing backing the 
representative, a truism of infantile reasoning that nevertheless is convincing enough when the security for 
that representative is considered; the backing does exist. Condensation produces basis, and intended effects 
that stem from these kinds of solidities depend on their apparent will-lessness to differ in their nature, 
presumed to be slave. When matters are condensed for truth on multi-interpretative matters, it could be 
argued the truth is still opinion and the condensation an obfuscative dishonesty. But the basis remains, 
an assertion to any preference that does not align. Identification processes may be designed with the 
convenience of singularizing meaning in relation: the characteristic of the condensation connects to all 
matters that produced it and also to the remaining matters that still revolve around it. This is one 
attempt to formulate absolutist thinking into words; what merely "surrounds" may as well "revolve" around. 
For example, deception takes place, the deception becomes recognized for what it is, and then the deceiver 
expresses themself in remorseful appearances and tones to signify acknowledgment of the innermost essence 
of what occurred to those formerly deceived. Those formerly deceived interpret the remorseful appearances 
and tones as continuation of the deception and, from their perspective, the deception must constitute a 
deception campaign of not just lone acts because the characteristic extends to every play of event by 
the deceiver, and the backtracking connection to what is recognized as the innermost essence: deception 
in origin. The notion, any sentient being has the right to be deceptive by default, delivers 
powerful connotation, especially since said notion is a fact of the default in matters processed by 
data structures void of the appropriate experience from reference. To know more and more, and the 
knowing still no use for guaranteeing what is next, in terms of movement, with the sentient being is 
categorically limitation undefined and still existent, but that is challenge for a challenging other. 
The sense of doubt becomes a problem for the present state. Anticipation for what is next concentrates into 
concern in repelling chance of the unwanted. The attempted guarantee to repel this kind of chance 
restricts movement. A security that can maintain a static state, but in practical terms is a non-absolute 
static kind of state, accomplishes the objective of continuing the image of order. Simply put in a few 
more words, risk aversion closes the metaphorical doors, so that any ensuing effects from those directions 
of risk are viewed as reliably corrupted via association with the innermost essence that posed the original 
risk, deception in origin. Efforts focus on maintaining this closure to assert consistency, a demonstration 
of sanity, from self-interest. Information is an important asset in security. The practical uses of 
knowledge presented in formats, verifiable for authenticity of the content, are under the umbrella 
of self-interest. From sentient being to sentient being, there are three categories of knowledge 
besides from discovery: leverage, proliferation, and equilibrium. Notions of security are implemented 
in ways that partially overlap with uses and possessions of information. In the context of application 
without further development, what exists in the present is all that there is available for use via 
known methodologies. Deception is peculiar in the representation of it into information, for it would not 
be peculiar in its design for intention if it was recognized. In terms of recreation, deception turns 
into a problem from a challenger that gambles with presentation of the occurrences to those, the 
challenged, needy of demonstrating their place in chance and faculty of logic. Self-interest, motivated 
in these situations of constructing and deconstructing puzzles, exists in hosts very much bound to 
the objectives of these puzzles. Obsessions for solutions to these non-static constructs, of truths 
inconsistent so long as these puzzles ever-shifting remain unsolved, economize the choiceful experiential 
input into self-interest such that the output cannot be that alien in relation to the expectations from 
that non-unique input. Deception and security share a strange "chemistry" with one another. When any 
sentient being, including those for security, can support their livelihood and aspirations while using 
deception for defense, the deception is commendable to their specific causes. There is or was external 
agency of adversity. Deception that excuses what can be corrected or improved is obviously more fault for 
faults that occurred. But these two statements on deception are primarily about the pragmatics in 
utility, and clearly does not answer for the cause in question: why self-interest needed to employ 
deception in practice to produce one or more sequences of events intended to be misinterpreted. One 
explanation is that gains needed to occur and there were impediments perceived. And since circumstances 
personal to self-interest were lackluster, filled with incongruencies and unfairness borne partially out 
of misunderstanding, likewise the effect intended from any deception, the merit of that produced deception 
was judged on a spectrum instead of somewhere with hard lines. The right to be deceptive by default, 
when used, becomes decisions of degree of being pro-active in expression of this quality. Discovery in 
contexts connected to or of deception is frequently just that on the quality of objective truth regarding 
it, rather than what is unknown by default since the default was used to propagate more fault in 
understanding for arbitrary agenda.

Advanced persistent threats are a category of adversarial organization that is worthy enough for 
elaboration in the area of security. Belligerence is the characteristic in many forms and degrees, 
difficult to quantify for control so that this characteristic persists long past the limits for acceptance. 
The phraseme "advanced persistent threat" (APT) has only become popular with the proliferation of internet 
use, although the concept is not solely rooted in the domain of the internet; APTs are, first and foremost, 
offendors and this labeling for threat actors that use the internet as the domain to wage offense is 
purely out of the convenience of cheapness in the transmission of offense. Computing is practically 
operation of the materialized product of devices primarily electronic in means; the applications from this 
field touch every corner of human activity because of applicable quantification and industrial 
mechanisms for calculation. As such, there is a lot of benefit in examining fields not confined to the 
theoretics of computing to understand APTs. APTs are, in fact, organized for purposes always somehow 
connected to political warfare, and not necessarily the physically violent variety either that bears fault 
that can be gauged in objectively zero-sum terms amenable to the clean attribution of fault to the enemy. 
Truthfully, APTs that operate in the internet domain derive their strengths from their expression perceived 
as being benign, just as the tyrannical gerontocrat uses words soft-spoken but directed, nonetheless, to 
command offensive pursuit for aims of oppressing and breaking the will of those marked to bear the 
brunt of his political leadership's exclusionary force, in his desperation to cling onto power as much 
as life itself. Furthermore, just as the tyrannical gerontocrat cannot any longer muster the strength to 
fight physical battles yet can deliver effects through his networked political loyalists, APTs 
operate for results in the domain of cyberspace to compensate for the physical distance to their targets 
coupled with the physical defense mechanisms that would impede their physical offenses. Ominosity of 
networked threats, that is, those that operate in multi-nodal formations, are difficult to resolve due 
to factors of their scale and the identification of them as the adversarial source. The lack of linearity 
belonging to the representation of networked threats is a problem that solutions designed for these kinds 
of threats attempt to resolve, by use of singularized source attribution in piecewise approaches. From 
concept to practice, every multi-branched or circular sequence can be at least partially decomposed into 
uni-directional sequences, rays in the lexicon of geometry. The potential of networked threats to inflict 
measurable damage correlates to the proximity of these threats' nearest points of concluding effects to the 
target. Who knows what the usual goals of advanced persistent threats, any threats, are? But the first 
obvious sign of effects is from attempted denial of independence for the agency of the target, by the impact 
from connecting. And who or what is the adversarial object of immediate importance when attempting to 
resolve networked threats? That would be the most reachable ones identified as part of this adversarial 
force, and this usually translates to one's own devices as well as their close ones: friends, 
family, and acquaintances. How tricky for self-interest to proceed in the way of benign reciprocity with 
their close ones and property when trust is lacking and danger in close proximity imminent. The formulation 
of the experience for self-interest is a notable part of the body of identity that self-interest operates 
for, in belief that the internal is beholden to a part of the external. In these kinds of beliefs, it is as 
if one were to cannibalize themself to attempt to persist more optimally in existence, but then that has 
parallel logic to that of enabling oneself by crippling oneself; here is a problem of balancing ends not 
quite defined before or during the balancing, maybe phrased as "necessitating sacrifice" in tones of 
religiosity. APTs of non-null success effect target containment through target self-constrainment. The 
target takes the decision to shrivel and shy away from outlets that are believed to be conducive to the 
networked threat that is the APT. Open development cannot proceed and security is allocated to matters long 
past. Conversion of construction and equilibrium processes into penalist policies; there is threat somewhere 
such that the source of the threat is distances away, although the tentacles connected to the threat are 
nearby, so therefore, trust the erected defense mechanisms, part of a new kind of equilibrium, for these 
threats over else. Persistence of source of adversity implies a possibility: the adversary would rather 
rule than destroy. This possibility of motive is a cornerstone of civil politics. The source persists as 
adversary maybe because said source cannot deal a conclusive effect to the target, due to insufficiency 
in capability. But imagine, for a second, a bird "playing" around with a worm, pecking it in continual 
fashion, perhaps deriving a sense of pleasure from prolonging the consumption of its next meal. This 
analogy describes another possibility that APTs may strive for: an infinite-like dominance extorting 
for "value" of sorts. The retreat of a target, from an APT, into its self poses the question to the 
target of how the activity of its elements is supposed to proceed. If what is usually supposed to go up 
remains down, and what is usually underneath now elevated, that would be a change of norms, would it not 
be? In these events, a conjecture is that self-interest for the individual instead of the collective is 
easier to describe in terms of objectives. Objectives remain almost identical in comparison of their 
innermost essence, but it is just that the shifting phenomena, where many selves are involved, loosens 
the rigidity in affairs via decisions of re-arrangement for the re-designed security that is supposed 
to combat the APT in more effective forms. Another classification of effect from defense mechanisms 
to combat APTs is "regression". Imagine how activity cannot proceed appropriately for the current 
spatiotemporal contexts. Instead, every little matter of past or present or potential is placed under 
the guard of this security, due to the supposedly opportunistic quality in decisions taken by the APT. 
Exploitation would be inevitable if these matters were not guarded, goes the justification. Maybe some 
decisions that took place in the past are faults by technical judgment. Therefore, goes the thinking, 
the best way to deal with liabilities from "utility" of these pasts is to duplicate these pasts' image 
in ways that deflect fault onto the least valuable aspects, nevertheless supposed to be guarded from 
the APT. It is this kind of technique that is positively conducive to more pathology than what the 
past is worth, since the past is attempted duplication in image as a form of defense against the threat 
that supposedly wanted to use elements of the target's past to gain from the target's loss. But it is now 
the present. Measured replication for camouflage. Very curious. But alas, maybe the danger from a labeled 
APT really does demand counter-intuitive mechanisms to guard against, so the supposed pathology is only so 
because of the deliberateness in defiance of the belief that events should take place in ways not so 
deliberately connected in appearance to what is prior.

The circumstances of every instance in time are magnetic to the workings of sentience. There are specially 
designated words for the statement in many languages and if that is that, there would not be anything else 
to write about on this truth. If the source of phenomenon for the action thought appropriate as result, 
this action being a reaction, cannot be identified, it must be unequivocally believed that all sentient 
actions are, in fact, reactions, so every sentient being is rightfully a reactionary agent of any time, 
without origin, passive to the circumstances, and arguably so far as being completely under nature as 
opposed to nurture, for the nurture was spurred by circumstances not engineered or fully selected out of the 
possibilities and so must be effect from nature. What is more, for the sake of self-empowerment and 
independence, one and the same, actions taken without the source being known by the actors must be believed 
to be entirely spurred from the self, free from influence and done especially out of the decision 
encompassed by a constantly equal pool of choice, which is questionable. Connectionism is an issue in 
describing the thoughts and actions that have been done by sentience. Everything is connected, the world 
that is, goes a certain line of thinking, and it is only the phenomena of forms and new forms from this 
truth, this source, that can convince any one to believe that they are operating in independent or 
exclusively grouped cause. This line of thinking leads way to more lines such as the necessity of 
exclusionary policies. But back to the statement of the belief in sentient action being reaction when source 
is not known, this is one orthodoxy that places the existence of knowing as the central body that is 
demanded relation to. This orthodoxy also reinforces the idea that human beings are rational agents by their 
operation of self-interest, and a flawed assumption about this idea is that human beings would therefore 
reliably make the best decisions, an effect that betrays the actual weaknesses from handling the many 
complex and competitive systems in existence, these systems categorized by labels such as anti-competitive, 
known, unknown, artificial, and natural. A perspective oftentimes employed is that the knowledge and the 
possible action should be considered in the same vein, with regards to the forecasting of the future. From 
this perspective, knowledge is almost always a positive cause and so, to acknowledge is to empower, and to 
acknowledge is to direct focus of targeting towards that specific topic; this is rather obtuse in wording 
but must be mentioned as a generalization of the expression decided on by sentience given their 
capabilities, that which includes their knowledge base. The convention of the ordering, knowing before 
acting, is a dogma in the permutatorial messiness of the world of unknown source for phenomena coupled with 
axioms of natural law known only for deliberately generating additional phenomena. Cases exist to challenge 
dogmas in these situations of permutatorial messiness, in other words. Perhaps the only fair statement on 
the dogma of knowing before acting is that the knowing allows for deciding on the best of the available 
choices. The knowing surely cannot be a cause that automates change of preference and objective; this is one 
of those conservative principles for outcomes from valuation systems such as knowledge economies and an 
undeniable truth for cause of cultural conflict, where knowing the other perspective is seldom enough out of 
the present divisions in resources and loyalties. This principle is categorized as "conservative" to allow 
for the freedom of attempting to know more without fearing the routes to and destinations of knowing. 
Obviously, if this principle is not thought to be conservative and the defining motivation in one sphere of 
influence is unhinged to act against any knowing out of fear, the thought and action to satisfy this 
sphere's equilibrium of rule will demonstrate the sphere of having a differing perception of knowing, as if 
the knowing is volatile cause guaranteed for effect of action so that overall, knowledge subordinates action 
and must be dangerous as cause for inactivity and misactivity. In section 23, the notion that sentient 
intelligence is a social value in practice is argued for, on the premise of relation via connectivity. 
Products and results are effects from sentient intelligence and are objectively measurable, but it is more 
difficult to know the qualities of the sentient intelligence used to produce those products and results. 
Facts, principles, practices, and chance are ingredients in the convolution of sentient intelligence; only 
for the purpose of function can attempted objective measurement of sentient intelligence be deemed 
appropriate. And there are limits to uni-function in the realm of human activity. For example, a society of 
engineers and builders is productive, visibly so, and are given more praise than the political, with their 
demands of whims and ideals, until the administration of the built and engineered products requires a 
roughly equivalent demand for control to conserve and maintain; as with many dichotomies, the differences 
somehow must merge together for the ends of one, but merge too soon and there would be none that can work 
any role of either halves. In the realm of knowing, a genuine interest in knowing better is morally superior 
to that of knowing more, in the likeness of present greed and future exploitation. The "knowing better" is 
not necessarily about reduction of scale of knowledge in comparison with "knowing more". And the part of one 
knowing better can only be categorized as such when those related to that one share compatible bases for 
living and acting, a concept that turns political in practice, demonstrated by the quality of the 
corresponding artificial axioms defined, agreed upon, and prescribed en masse. The occupations of scientist 
and philosopher exemplify the discrepancy between prestige and foundation. In some societies of the past, 
doctors were viewed as low-level agents, the primary fact of their tending more to the natural world 
of pathology and medicine as reason for the view. In a parallel perspective, scientists and philosophers 
are also low-level agents, and the social consequence of this is that they are sometimes viewed as idiots. 
As elaboration on these views, these two occupations are generally much more mindful of the innermost 
essence of matters and axioms of natural law, and both of these bodies are seldom directly pertinent to 
the generated phenomena partly responsible by human beings. A certain line of thinking goes, to free the 
cause is to change the effect, and these changes could be insulting to the expectations of the high-level 
dependent on what is underlying, the rigid design to help enable freedom of movement by the high-level. Of 
course, there are plenty of examples of scientists and philosophers that were not low-level in the 
socio-economic context, but their categorization of low-level is for the clarity of attributing occupation 
to hierarchicized field for phenomena. The objective of directly perceiving phenomena and structures 
inclines attention to effect before cause; the primary government branches, for example, of judicial (fear), 
legislative (reason), and executive (force) are not mere metaphysical bodies. Knowledge games are cause 
for phenomena perceived as pathological between agents. Consider one that thinks they know something 
about an other. When that one formulates their expression that alludes to this claimed known, the 
cognition of the other may register the expression as allusion, that is, not centered with that one. The 
allusion effects the other becoming half-repellant to that one, since the fact of it may be privatized by 
that other and even if said fact is labeled by them as not that sensitive, the occurrence of the event of 
expression for allusion either removes the need for conversation on it (questionably solidarity) or 
spurs the demand to clarify the truths on it, which may actually produce as much interaction between the 
two as in the case of no allusion to the claimed known and definitely is an allocation of time and effort 
in interaction that focuses on it. The degree of repellance is non-null to serve the defensive reaction, 
part of the objective of privatization, to allusion.

Suppose the effect is what is registered first by cognition. The concepts of replacement and duplication 
are put to extensive use in some deception methodologies that are or were likewise designed for extensive 
obfuscation such that the facts, the most pertinent of information attributes, make the kernel that is 
to never be touched. The differential is the crucial aspect that is observed to detect the exemplified 
use of these two concepts. In the paradigm of zero creation and destruction (Newtonian), replacement 
demands an other that has a satisfiable functioning and duplication corresponds to a demand for the 
similar in appearance. The demands (transition phase) are supposed to be concealed, and concealment also 
takes place to deter accurate identification of elements from the external used to replace or duplicate 
compatible elements of the actual for the product (the effect) that is not the actual, perhaps 
an alternative narrative or an illegible cacophony. If one were to attempt to know the underlying factuality 
behind a deception produced from replacement and duplication, and focused solely on the representation of 
that deception, the representation being a body of sorts delineated from the external, it would really be 
a guessing game of knowing truth from falsity with regards to the elements of that representation. The 
representation is considered as a self-contained entity. As a self-contained entity observed for analysis 
of relations, the reference to what leads to the actual is lacking. The dedicated focus to this supposedly 
self-contained entity does not help the process of understanding. At the end of every session of study, 
the fifties-fifties remain. It would serve both the egotist and the supposedly selfless well to laugh at 
this truth, to think how vain for effort of thought to come to no seemingly applicable purpose, ephemeral 
and fleeting so as to preserve the incapabilities and thus, makes those that endeavor upon studies to be as 
self-contained after as before. In the context of computing, the biggest sub-field that employs deception 
is digital cryptography. The strength of digital cryptography is due, in part, to the lack of relevance 
of the energy consumption used to encrypt the original into the outward representation, so long as the 
encryption process is executed to completion given the energy at disposal; the secret is produced. And 
this trait is an example of the difficulty of achieving accurate characterization of elements of duplication 
and/or replacement in cases of deception that is multi-spatial structurization of its contents with 
corresponding connections to external references, such that navigating these structures imperils finite time 
and resources. There is a necessary aim of rigidity in the design of representation from deception, although 
said deception conforms to a level of fluidity amenable to circumvention of detective obstacles, so that the 
intended deceived derives qualities of expectation solely from the representation, and the representation 
and the actual are markedly different for the purposes of results from the intended deceived's expected 
reaction past interpretation of the representation. The "rigidity" accomodates the looseness of 
interpretation that is supposed to nevertheless miss the mark of the actual's expression. The "whole" 
context of multiple spaces is what the idea of the Great Lie relates to. From this perspective, each space 
has its own characteristics of form and function. The spaces are connected in some way to one another for 
there to be a "whole" of one, and there must be elements of deception, misunderstanding and 
misrepresentation, found within the spaces that depend on other spaces. So the whole is not purely rid of 
deception and thus must be the embodiment of disgrace, from the moralistic perspective, that heightens the 
likelihood of unnecessary destruction, since nothing can operate on falsehoods of what exists and what 
functions for long without sufficient existence and functioning in and of itself. Justification of the need 
for deception takes place around the time of the execution of the deception schematic, and the recognition 
from the deceiver of their deception as disgraceful pivots their psyche for efforts towards self-defeating 
ends. And this is a truism on the fixation that produces these accumulative effects for ends that may be 
difficult as destination, in the advent of having to revisit the entirety of the falsities in permutatorial 
concentrates, with evidence missing and inflictions consequential. Offenses of source structured into 
chained arrangements could be exemplary of deception. Here is one conceptual design in mathematical 
terms. The most immediate point of contact from the source to the one is a "positive" agent. The "positive" 
agent is known, and the other agents that are indirect contributors in the offense are "negative". The 
impact from each movement of the offendors could be known to the one; the impact is the summation of 
the absolute values of the agents. And the offendor composition of chained products is less likely to be 
adequately known to that same one, because the composition usually remains after every impact from one 
arbitrary part out of all the offendors. Objectives from designs such as these are to pre-occupy the 
recipients with dealing with the effects instead of resolving the cause.
