The uniqueness of all philosophies of self-interest are but 
a fraction of any other. In more words, that is because this 
kind of philosophy is not self-contained, instead required to 
extract and derive knowledge from other fields of the natural 
and social sciences alike, in order to put things into practice. 
Because self-interest can only be realized through personal practice, 
only the theory and the theoretics of the totality can be understood 
beforehand, and the self as a finite spatiotemporal concept can 
self-derive a petty fraction of the theory and theoretics. Specific 
fractions of the theory and theoretics are selected by the self-interested 
based on their preferences. This, in and of itself, is a form of 
prejudice. Moreover, the field of self-interest can never reach the 
fundamental low level of abstraction because it is one based on the 
utility of available choice, essentially economics in the individualistic 
sense, and the utility is always centered around the self.

The philosophy of self-interest is one that leans towards the 
private and privatization of value. Every philosopher must have 
reached their destinations in mind and body through the will, the 
fuel for self-interest to take place. Instead of fostering the language 
of general truth for the universal understanding, the philosophy of 
self-interest instead takes direction from the general truth to the 
self for the self, and also from the specific truth to that same self 
for that same self. So that is one key difference between these two 
categories of philosophers, although the philosopher that does not 
proselytize self-interest may actually be working for a collective 
interest that they think greatly benefits their self-interest. In the 
general sense, the lines involved in dualities that are then arbitrarily 
interpreted by the mind as “hard” or “soft” lines make the philosopher 
and their morality better understood by their craft of philosophy, not 
by the benefits bestowed onto them because of their craft. But one that 
is a philosopher is not strictly one of that one role.

Not to discredit the category of self-interest as a philosophy, 
but this kind of philosophy indeed serves defeatist purposes to 
the “love of wisdom", philosophy, if the assumption of “love” or 
“wisdom” having to be shared is the default requirement for a field 
to be called a class of philosophy. Self-interest also carries 
connotations of independence, liberty, and autonomy, which then 
subjects the rules and beliefs found in knowledge under the self-interested 
for their existence and decision-making. Philosophies of self-interest, 
when taught, causes the glorification of the individual. And since the 
human being arguably has a tendency to already be self-justifying, this 
tendency going all the way down to the biological immune system, there 
is a limit to how much the self can further their understanding by directly 
tending to the self by the internal means of the self. These philosophies 
cannot grow in and of themselves, only serving as backgrounds of reminder 
to encourage the individual past the general that bounds all under it.

Technical difficulties exist in the usage of natural language to explain 
philosophies of self-interest. For one thing, what is the self from one 
to another? When one thinks that their self somehow can be comprised by 
thoughts of the external, such as others’ selves, that is when the “self” 
in self-interest is no longer a direct line from the external projection 
of one to their internal workings. It is possible for one to inflate their 
notion of their self to include the lives of others, for that one to claim 
they know what is best for the other that is part of their conceptualization 
of their self, in turn morphing the understanding of self-interest as what 
suits the individual to what suits the individual and their people. Economics 
play a fundamentally great role in self-interest. If what is best for a 
specific individual is best for the common good, then what is self versus 
collective interests? Unfortunately for the language of ideals in explaining 
the interests of sentient beings, there are inevitable clashes and mergers 
between the self separated from the remaining world and the self alongside 
other selves in the same world.

Philosophies of self-interest have a murky aura in their teaching and 
interpretation. The phrasing, “murky aura”, is carefully selected to describe 
the kind of replicability and factuality in fields that desire to translate 
the subjective into the objective, that is, the formulated solution that the 
practitioner of self-interest wishes to use. This translation of the subjective 
to the objective is done primarily by the practitioner. And the teacher of 
self-interest to the student educates by means not entirely forward (murky). 
Suppose self-interest to be a vital metaphysical aspect of every being. The 
teacher has the question of putting full effort into educating the student on 
the teacher’s conceptualization of the self that is then supposed to be used 
by the student. The student, on the other hand, has the question to take as 
truth or fallacy any of the teacher’s educative statements on how they should 
nurture their own self-interest. It cannot be factually stated that only 
philosophical educations of self-interest can serve the great purpose for 
continuing legacy. Legacy is a cousin of the lone “self”, separated by degrees 
minor or major based on the lone self’s measure of accepting the historicism 
purportedly connected to them. One that proselytizes philosophy may use the 
language, poetics, and other communicative devices that give off the impression 
of no disproportional interest from their self for their self. Attempts to build 
a rational framework of expectations for students from each school of philosophy 
may very well be folly, especially in terms of self-interest, one that rests on 
the concept of “choice” more so than “obligation”.

# More on philosophies of self-interest #5

The use of self-interest for one’s purpose always rests on systems, 
axiomatic principles pieced together for at least a metaphysical construct 
of reference. Attempting to teach another what is self-interest rests on the 
principle that can be expressed as, “do what you think or feel fit”. This 
expression uses loose wording, and opens rational-like pathways for moral 
relativism, a paradigm of thought that is not entirely confined to the truths 
of the fundamental, and is thus not at the same centrality of truth as 
fundamental philosophy that can produce the precision of science. Many will 
argue that philosophy and ethics can be one and the same, but this is a 
misconception that has led many down very regrettable roads. Here is a 
convention: there is philosophy, then mathematics, then physics, chemistry, 
and biology. Many fields past biology, then there is ethics. So those that 
claim philosophy and ethics can be one and the same must either believe that 
their view on ethics is true enough right down to the philosophical level, 
thus negating any social opposition to their view of ethics, or they must 
abide by the fundamental in expressing their views in the social context, 
this abidement granting them the liberty of not having to pose and advance 
opinion or preference as truth for the proper mannerisms of ethics. The 
default setting of self-interest being dependent on existing systems, as 
initially mentioned, means that abstract language to teach one on self-interest 
cannot start with interests of the self without the relation to something other. 
The focus on the self as an internalist construct is more so about independent 
maintenance and development, but both of these independent objectives depend 
on existing systems of methodology and material, as well. Abstracting the 
concept of the “self” for expression of these notions’ truths to another 
has shortfalls in specificities. The abstract can never capture the entire 
meaning of the “self” in a universal and thorough manner, without the “self” 
having to be the one responsible for induction to suit their specific forms 
and movements.

# More on philosophies of self-interest #6

A posit on self-interest that cannot be proven wrong, no matter how unlike 
the fundamental truth it may be interpreted as, is that communicating to another 
a conceptualization of the “self” that they should adhere to is already at least 
one mark off from the centrality of the “self”. It is like the difference between 
any 0 and any 1; there is a space of 1 in between the two. Another posit, of a 
plausible nature, is that communication of a conceptualization of self-interest 
is not precisely about the merging of the “self” with “interest”, instead about 
the practice of self-interest, not about exactly one of the “self” or “interest”. 
The “self” should tend to their “interest”, not to something other than their 
“interest”. But there is a separation in meaning and existence between the “self” 
and the “interest”, the “interest” only being labeled this term due to factors 
that include the propensity of the “self” for it. The “self” can be influenced in 
ways, foreign to their bare state, to develop an interest for something that 
otherwise would not have occurred. Even in terms of the “self” without the 
influencer, at least a communicator if not an accepted educator, the “self” 
is not bound to a steadfast guarantee of conceptualizing their “self” in the 
same representation for all contexts. Compare notions of self-interest, these 
notions representing one or more philosophies of self-interest, with other 
abstract fields of thought. In these other fields of thought, the “self” can 
put aside their conscious conceptualization of their “self” to comprehend those 
understandings for replication or constructive utilization. But with the “self”, 
there are comprehensions of the comprehensions from the “self”, and comprehensions 
of the image projected from the “self”, and comprehensions of alternative ways of 
expression, alternative images, for the “self” to project their “self” by their 
chosen means for their wanted image.

Another origin problem, this one on self-interest. Does the “self” first have 
to learn about their “interest” through a sequence of events that is their 
experience, or through trial-and-error unintentionally finds an “interest”? 
Both of these possibilities are identical in at least half of all ways. Whether 
by chance or through the deliberation before acceptance, the “interest” becomes 
a fixation of the “self” to fulfill the “self” by acting in the manner of positive 
relation to the “interest”. In these two possibilities that comprise the whole of 
possibilities for the “self” to discover the “interest”, an interest so great the 
“self” thinks and acts in the direction of it in their belief that it is their 
“self-interest”, it may reason that the supposed randomness of trial-and-error 
and the experience are identical in outputting the same preference as discovery 
to the “self” that then embraces the preference as part of their entire self-interest. 
The phrasing of this origin problem is not merely for the humorous word play of 
differences that rest on a fundamental sameness. The fundamental sameness of 
self-interest in practice cannot be established, and concepts such as “selfishness” 
and “narcissism” are not constant associations with “self-interest”. The first 
possibility of the origin problem supposes the “self” to co-exist in the sequence 
of events. This co-existence is their experience. But in the second possibility, 
the “self” is described as a pro-active agent in the sequence of events, this 
sequence of events at least partly consisting of their choice design for the 
trial-and-error. These characteristic differences then force differing ways of 
explaining self-interest as a universal force, and practices of self-interest 
play out in various ways outside of categorization that can capture the specific 
without categorization that is specific to each specific of the specific. Validation 
of self-interest, as one or more philosophies, tend to draw connections of likeness 
between differing practices believed by the practitioners to be in the name of their 
respective self-interests, and these connections of likeness then converge to singular 
principles on what self-interest is, practices by selves that each one conducts in 
and on their respective systems.

# More on philosophies of self-interest #8

Self-interest, a force that depends on the utility of existing systems, 
perhaps to maintain those existing systems or to improve or to abolish 
them from affecting the “self”, is something circular and most definitely 
self-serving if self-contained, coincidentally self-serving if not. But 
the quality of self-containment is not a consistent variable in outcomes, 
as a reminding note. The centrality of this concept, self-interest, almost 
instantaneously radiates outward in different practice by mass selves. 
There are unclear answers on how self-interest plays a part in socio-economic 
power dynamics, something very fundamental to human beings, frequently 
likened to “social creatures” from the antiquity of thought. To distribute 
the values of power to those in need of those values of power, to retain 
power in order to grow it and build it for the “self” above all. These 
objectives ring familiar bells on the dichotomy of control between the 
state (questionably communist) and the individual (questionably capitalist), 
a dichotomy that remains on one-sided terms if expressed only in verbal 
or written language, flimsy and lofty due to the freedom of interpretation, 
decorative because there is action for construct and then there are words 
for persuasion. These statements, on power dynamics as something the force 
of self-interest has to contend with, rather escalated quickly from the 
realm of something just above the abstract to something not quite exact 
with words, interpretation, and practice in the mass sentient setting. 
With escalations such as these, the role of self-interest as the single 
and active force is not without challenge, for practices stemming from 
fields such as control theory and decision theoretics become the foremost 
point of analysis. And through the backtracking that analyses can produce, 
perhaps self-interest can be narrowed down in the specifics of practice 
amongst its many hosts. This elaboration has at least provided some proof, 
through example, that self-interest is in fact not a self-contained field, 
due to its many outward forms that chooses existing systems to use.

# More on philosophies of self-interest #9

Philosophies of self-interest emphasize to followers principles similar 
to utilitarian ideals. The concept of “self-interest”, when put into 
practice, depends on the usage of existing systems, as already stated. 
And the essential, perhaps the only criteria uniting all that think and 
act in their way for their “self-interest”, is the utility having to be 
geared to the “interest”, done by the “self”. Utilitarian thought is almost 
entirely about the “self” co-existing in the world by acting in a way 
recognized as proper use of systems, in material or immaterial form, by 
those systems’ piecewise or holistic components. Utilitarian thought promotes 
the utility of maximizing output for the “self” given the input, the ideal 
selection/s in the candidates of systems and system components, and this 
is an integrational approach that requires sentient living to make use. 
The sentient being is obliged to be capable of learning about some material 
or skill, then putting a sort of full effort into utilizing that learned 
material or skill, and the physical expression of the sentient being as 
well as their thought generated is frequently connected to the use of 
their preferred material or immaterial system/s, a synergistic fusing, 
per se. Utilitarianism is thus quite externalist, that through what is a 
solution coinciding by construction or existence in the external, there 
is satisfaction. The paradigm also leans towards the transcendental ideals 
of sentient beings, namely human beings, being able to be one with the 
environment, for their cognition to find “happiness” and “comfort” by 
behaviors of domination of their recognized adversities through satisfying 
their recognized problems from and of their “self”. Now, on to “self-interest”. 
With “self-interest”, there is less emphasis on demanding behavior by the 
“self” to exist, in some way or form, in a “comfort zone”. The “self” pursues 
the “interest”, but this does not mean that the “self” and the “interest” 
are not already bound to one another. The “self” can self-understand as 
“self-interest”, identical in cognition. Whereas with utilitarianism, there 
are factors (happiness, et cetera) that the “self” somehow thinks are 
objectives, and thus separated from them in some way, but these objectives 
are what the “self” yearns and strives for by correcting or maintaining the 
expression of behavior in line with their route for these objectives. 
“Self-interest”, in practice, also has objectives, but the objectives do 
not magnetize the host of the “self” for the “self” to act towards them. 
A convincing statement is that “self-interest” is self-driven, propelled 
by the “self” for the “self-interest” thought of by the “self” to be their 
“self”. However, this should not be interpreted as selflessness, for as 
already defined, the “interest” of the “self” is what the “self”, itself, 
is as immortally connected to as what cannot be defined in the scientific 
terms of the material. Objectives of “self-interest” can change, while 
“self-interest” is a constant with the freedom of varying outward expression. 
“Self-interest” is governed by internalist construct, not innately governed 
by foreign metaphysical or physical forces, and is an element higher in level 
to “motivation” in the hierarchy of cognition. As for utilitarianism, the 
paradigm is a stepping stone towards the pragmatic of developing or obtaining 
solution, typically for the “self”, by conscientious observance and learning 
of the external world. And with the solution achieved, there is a satisfying 
sense in their reaching a finalistic goal, in which case, the sensible courses 
of action and thought for the utilitarian is maintenance of their state by the 
utility, required by them to be controlled by them, of the solution. Since 
“self-interest” has objectives, the satisfaction of these objectives is either 
the solution itself for the “self”, or the approach taken is the solution. 
But “self-interest” remains, and there is not a universal agreement on how 
the self-interested can evolve or form new objective. The de-emphasis of 
external reference to the concept of “self-interest”, in relation to 
utilitarianism, means that the regulatory patterns used by the “self” for 
their “self-interest” do not necessarily have to coincide with external 
material or immaterial.

# More on philosophies of self-interest #10

Manipulative agents such as material, reactions from the material, and 
other means (“agents”, in this usage) that influence cognition become 
paramount variables differentiating the expression of one for utilitarian 
and another for their “self-interest”. The term “interest” in “self-interest” 
serves as an emphasizer on the “interest” in this concept, as something on 
top of “motivation” and tied to the “self”, for the “self” to both exist 
and operate in ways with “interest” so that an “interest” originating from 
outside the self (other selves) is not in the same lane, and there is only 
one lane for the “interest” that the “self” can pursue such that the 
“interest” is immortally connected to the “self”. In utilitarian practice, 
there is a persistent pressure to achieve an equilibrium, and out of 
pragmatism, efforts are concentrated around that stationary point reached, 
the equilibrium. “Self-interest”, on the other hand, encounters more 
incongruencies in the form of friction between the “self” tied to the 
“interest” and the situational decisions the “self” is faced with making. 
The “self”, as self-driven by their “self-interest”, has the liberty to 
modify the directionality of will for these decisions unideal, not of the 
form for a reasonable number of transformations to reach the “ideal” that 
the “self-interest” seeks. But the modification of the will by “self-interest” 
could, in turn, richochet back to the “self” as something understood as a 
pathological action, something incorrect and thus malicious against “self-interest”. 
The “self”, as an agent of their “self-interest”, acts in ways of distinctness 
to challenges that do not necessarily have to be connected to any objective 
of the “self-interest”. Utilitarian compromise of the “self” by the “self” 
taking a particular means to accomplish the objective may also be a possibility 
for the case of the “self” for “self-interest”. But compromise of the “ideal” 
by the “self” is rationalized by the self-interested as something similar to 
forced negotiation. Utilitarian thought only views compromise as forced negotiation 
when the compromise is of a relatively imposing downward force onto the “self”, 
since it is more integrationist, whereas integration could be a result of 
“self-interest” solely through the drive of the “self-interest” for that result, 
the destination. There is less of the two ends, the “self” and the solution, 
meeting half-way in initiatives by the “self” for “self-interest” than by 
utilitarian practice. Thus, utilitarian practice is typically more pre-determined 
than the self-interested in setting limits, not aspirations.

# More on philosophies of self-interest #11

The broad field of choice is of the abstract unquantifiable not because 
of the practice of choice in the spatiotemporal setting. The spatiotemporal 
setting limits the span/s of effecting choice, and the exact degrees of 
spatiotemporal limitation is one crucial factor for the perception of 
determinism, something the self-driven “self” with their “self-interest”, 
in necessary connection to the physical host, has to cooperate with, in 
order to guard the mortality of the host. There are levels to this cooperation. 
It starts with co-existing alongside natural law, laws governing any phenomenon 
that are not subject to the will of the sentient. And then there are activities 
by sentient beings, through their physicalities stemming from natural law. 
Further along, there is the practice of non-physical interaction from sentient 
beings, with purposes such as manipulation of the will belonging to the “self” 
and socialization with the “self”. Manipulation of the will belonging to the 
“self”, to clarify, is externally sourced. Changes of the will’s directionality 
occurs through modification by the “self”’, but this modification if initialized 
by the external is manipulation. The force of “self-interest” is not bound to 
be constant or consistent in outward expression, due to the immediate span of 
choice, free from the spatiotemporal setting, for the “self”. Utilitarian 
initiatives can fall through or take detours into other initiatives. There 
is a difference in the manipulability present. “Self-interest” and utilitarianism 
are partly evident through the expression. But the “interest” to the “self” is 
of a lower level of difference than the objective/s of the “self”, due to chosen 
utility, to the “self”. The “interest” and the “self” are separate only in wording, 
in the context of “self-interest”. But with utilitarianism, there is the “self”, 
their chosen utility given their span/s of choice, and their objective. The degree 
of change in expression for the self-interested has a higher potential of difference 
to that of the utilitarian, one who thinks and acts as a subject of the spatiotemporal 
setting, although not necessarily for objectives that lie in any spatiotemporal setting. 
In manipulation, “self-interest” remains as a force but expresses by something not 
from the original, free from it, due to effects of the external’s changes of the 
will’s directionality. The self-interested that decides on being utilitarian thinks 
and acts in ways not of the original to “self-interest”, if manipulated, and thus 
fails to be utilitarian in the required identity of the original. And the utilitarian 
that is not one purely with their “self-interest” can also be manipulated, such as 
through the alterations and demands presented to them in their spatiotemporal setting, 
although the directionality of the will is still original to the “self-interest”.

# More on philosophies of self-interest #12

Philosophies of self-interest tend to overlap with studies and practices of ethics, 
due to the fact that “self-interest” is necessarily existent and then perhaps evident 
for the practice. And ethics is, as per the wisdom that the human being is a “social 
creature”, a fixture for the “social” creature of subjectivity before objectivity in 
their priorities, the fixture as analysis in the form of cross-examinations and 
introspections relatable to but not required to be related to the natural sciences, 
since sentient being’s understanding of the natural sciences bears relevance outside 
of the manuscripts and natural phenomenon as practiced by sentient beings, practices 
coinciding with natural phenomenon but differs to natural phenomenon by their sole 
association to sentient will, so will has the effecting autonomy to heed natural 
phenomenon for the “self-interest”. This last point of natural phenomenon being 
separate from sentient will is necessary not to promote arguments in duality and 
beyond. Ethics requires separability of cause-and-effect, through means arbitrary 
by reference to natural law that then governs natural phenomenon, for comprehending 
accountable human beings in accountable constructs of human beings; the term 
“accountable” could be interchanged with “responsible” due to interpretations 
from “self-interest”. The aims of ethics for the practice of the subject can be 
phrased as: the demand for satisfactory utility of the entire span of fields, from 
philosophy through the natural sciences to ethics and also past ethics in the 
application of ethics in arbitrarily structured format, this being the “law for 
human beings”.

# More on philosophies of self-interest #13

Through the lens of ethics, the thinking and actions of sentient beings can 
be what is called “judged” in the form of adjectives that carry more than 
quantitative meaning, although anything with quantitative meaning can be 
directly associated with adjectives not under the domain of quantity, so 
elaboration on this point is needed. Some examples of the thinking and actions 
of sentient beings can then be argued, in ways convincing to untamed sentiments 
of “self-interest”, moving the directionality of will for “self-interest”, to 
be adjectives such as “foolish”, “criminal”, “unruly”, and “dishonest” with 
great followings for intended results such as great grievances, great inflation 
of ego, et cetera. In a related field, there is drama, and the structurization 
of sentient activity, namely the activity of human beings, into that which elicits 
sentiment is dramatization. Without subjectivity, there can be no ethics. With 
subjectivity in the form of intense sentiment expressed in outward form by the 
will, sometimes in opposition to the directionality of origin belonging to the 
“self-interest”, ethics serves as the field that regulates through the encouragement 
of introspection alongside outward observation of case studies, in juxtaposition to 
the form the literary fields take, record and narration for the product being a 
drama from dramatization. And this is not meant to lead to assumption that ethics 
does not require recording and narration, only that the centrality of ethics is 
in regulating human behavior, by the basic internal-external duality mentioned, 
without the necessity of prescribed consequences as manifested by practices of 
“law for human beings” that use ethics as a cornerstone. The practice of ethics 
can use drama, but this particular intersection should not be confusing on the 
purpose, even though the effects of ethics and drama can converge to be one and 
the same. Orthodoxically, drama elicits, draws in cognition to produce output from 
cognition, and ethics is intended to encapsulate the comprehension of behaviors, 
represented as narrative cover or indisputable truths of phenomenon, for principles 
of thinking and behavior to be set into place, thus influencing the effects of the 
will’s directionality onto the “self” because of their “self-interest”. “Self-interest”, 
in its more outward appearances of sentient thinking and behavior, is undeniably tied 
to ethics, the connection a cause of varying doubt and conviction through the question 
for the cause of the “self-interest”.

# More on philosophies of self-interest #14 

The previous note made the claim: "without subjectivity, there can be no 
ethics". Furthering the argument in favor of this claim, a very 
well-known concept called the "sphere of influence" is used. So without 
subjectivity, there is no need for ethics because ethics is what is 
conducted by sentient will to be analyzed by sentient will, namely that 
of human beings since ethics is anthrocentric, for dualistic judgment of 
the effects from sentient will. Judgments are necessary because effects 
by sentient will are of an inferiority to the low-level correctness of the 
authentic axiom. Effects by sentient will only demand proper utility of 
whatever authentic axiom. All axioms are authentic in the scope of truth's 
judgment. However, the adjective "authentic" was derived from "axiom" and 
placed before "axiom" to emphasize the nature of the axiom, not of an 
artificial unit or any other unit that can be utilized by the will, not 
ruling the wanted effects of sentient will. The construct of a sphere of 
influence is curious with regards to the intention of axiom. One concept is 
quite clearly the prime unit of human rationale on why spheres of influences 
are formed: "self-interest". It is self-interest before collective interest, 
although the critical variable of success may be collective interest. But the 
measurable quantity of any effecting collective interest would be given a 
distortion in appearance if it was likened to a single variable in the manner 
of use for conventional algebraic expressions in mathematics. The collective, 
meaning the mass of human beings, after reaching consensus on the predominant 
initiatives, although the specific form and the specific movement of each of 
the collective does not have to coincide and only required to overlap in 
judgment of similarity, consists of individuals with self-interests that 
overlap. This phenomenon, in every case of a united collective, goes back by 
reason to how the "self" understands the "self" along with "interest" for 
their "self-interest", understanding that takes into account co-existing 
selves and self-interests. It is also through the sphere of influence that 
absurdities are believed, by those of or against the construct. Absurdities 
are the most farfetched out of the class of believable fallacies, although 
this may be reasonably put into question out of wordplay and misunderstanding 
of the word "absurdity". Another case of the technical difficulties in using 
natural language as the primary tool of explanation. "Absurd" could be "ridiculous", 
but "ridiculous" could be true, while "absurd" is less in believability than a 
"half-truth", a concept with a quantitative mark attached to describing a 
statement in truth. The question of believing a statement or body of statements 
is a decision by "self-interest" to accept only if the "self" is aligned with 
its own will in a way that can be visualized as a direct alignment between 
"self-interest", undetachable from the "self" in any conceptualization, and the 
will of the "self". The freedom to visualize is the freedom to fabricate on 
matters such as the intangible, immeasurable by most natural (biological) senses, 
and especially the immeasurable. To elaborate on a possible route of crafting 
believability of an absurdity, think of a random human being as being labeled 
an adjective, and this labeling is upheld by the sphere in the same aura as the 
believability of an axiom. From there, the sphere of influence operates in the 
manner of a mechanical system that either does not have to perform frequent 
introspection or one that does not have introspective capabilities. The human 
being is claimed to have done some particular things. Because the sphere of 
influence labeled that particular human being a specific adjective, members 
of the sphere of influence, in turn, believe the human being to have done those 
particular things, without anything close to being as real as the direct experience 
that can be recalled by cognitive instruments of healthy structure, such as human brains.

# More on philosophies of self-interest #15

Subjectivity is a matter for cognition, with two primary bodies of 
understanding and believing it. This is a duality that adds to the 
complexity of the duality between the subjective and the objective. The 
first body is the objective that can be represented as the subjective, for 
a version of the objective that has the validity of being subject to challenge 
from sentient will or comparison with alternatives on scales selected by 
"self-interest". For something to be objective does not necessitate that something 
to be about the axiom, or for the axiom. The objective, by "self-interest", is a 
design constructed by the axiom for a wanted truth to be actualized, typically 
through perceivable action by a sentient being, and the wanted truth is not of 
the same fundamental as the axiom but something left to chance, probability with 
no absolute for one outcome, with probability that is intended to be manipulated 
for the wanted outcome/s by focus of effort on the input of said wanted outcome/s. 
Design of anything can be interpreted in the subjective by the use of "self-interest" 
operating on a will of a contrarian comparison to the design. Similarly, the term 
"style" can be used synonymously with "design". A convention for usage, however, 
is "design" is for the inanimate material structured by sentience, and "style" 
is the movement outwardly communicated by "self-interest". In both of these, 
"self-interest" determines the preference that requires satisfying of axiom/s, 
although "self-interest" does not need to acknowledge the existence or most accurate 
(by relativity) expression of the axiom. The axiom exists without usage. The axiom 
is what existence orbits around. The axiom is one among many in essence, the 
irreducible and unmanipulable core that is responsible for producing sentient 
will. Any "use" of the axiom in fact subjects one to being an agent of the axiom, 
and so any construct made by sentience first has to subject one or more sentient 
beings to represent the axiom/s. A belief is then given credit to those that uphold 
the construct, affirming the illusion that with the construct, an arbitrary number 
of axiom/s can be controlled by supercession of the construct's expression over 
arbitrary use. Truthfully, the axiom/s cannot be controlled, rather the expression 
in ways possibly more than by written or verbal communication can be controlled. 
The action because of "self-interest" is also prone to the illusion of control 
over the axiom. It is for this reason that sentient "objective" is quite often 
due entirely to the subjective, the preference by "self-interest" out of the 
will's directionality. The "objective" is not entirely predictable, outside of 
demand to sustain the physical host of "self-interest" (nutrition). Subjectivity, 
through challenge posed by "self-interest" from the will, can also be used to 
represent the axiom in non-interfering ways with the axiom. The constant existence 
of the axiom does not require recognition, in accurate forms for action from 
the axiom, from "self-interest".

The sphere of influence, being a construct that "self-interest" navigates 
and operates in, practically connected to the spatiotemporal context, has 
to be thought of as a practice by the decision of "self-interest", given 
their actionable span/s of choice. This view does assume that those capable 
of "self-interest" are not deterministic, something debatable. The ancient 
Thracian Democritus, from a long time ago, offered wisdom on the understanding 
of the world in the form of the Democritean atom, a precursor notion with 
virtually no practical application until nuclear science became formalized 
for engineering purposes in the 20th century. But for fair credit in attribution, 
it was those of the thinking along Democritus that helped continue the rationalization 
of individuality right down to the "self-interest", capable of generating the thought 
and action completely distinct from immediately neighboring self-interests of other 
selves. There cannot be much misconception from the "self" about the "self-interest" 
that affects the "self", only the host of the "self", since them two are inextricably 
connected such that the written form for the "self" is a synonym of the written form 
for the "self-interest". The objective is where "self-interest" may be undeserving 
of or misled towards. And the lack of objective exclusive to the "self" is what is 
sometimes required by the judgment of the collective, in turn expressing the self-guiding 
axiom of the "self-interest" by affecting the will, in ways such as alteration of the 
will's directionality. Here is where perception of a particular "self", this written 
use of "self" meant to consider the "self" as something observable from a third-party 
perspective, may also be influenced by the judgment of that same "self" in the paradigm 
of a particular sphere of influence. Judgments of the qualities belonging to a sphere 
of influence are by use of probabilistic means, and can be misconceived as 
absolutist or dualist due only to the specific categorical labels considered 
by judgment. "Transcendence" is a label for "spiritualistic" or "emotive" 
phenomenon that breaks out of containment, the sphere of influence or something 
directly connected to the sphere of influence, for timespans not so temporary. 
The "transcendence" is typically metaphysical when related to "self-interest" 
as a phenomenon experienced by the host of "self-interest". The containment is 
usually a mixture of the physical and the metaphysical (immeasurable cognition 
and other bodily functions belonging to the host of "self-interest") connected 
to "self-interest". It is the notion of "transcendence", something similar to 
triumph in the visual depiction of floating or soaring upwards, that is a 
cornerstone of representing the power of "self-interest" to be victorious in 
adversarial conditions. Glorifying portrayals of events, historical or entirely 
fictional, by themes such as corruption, liberation, and rebellion heavily rests 
on the abstract of floating or soaring upwards in ways obviously physical for 
the intended effects of eliciting belief that the spiritual sense likewise moves 
in the same orientation, this being the "transcendence" from the construct, 
the sphere of influence, unwanted by the "self-interest" for the "self" to 
exist in or co-exist with. The first layer of activity for the "self-interest" 
is seldom the last layer in matters of the physical, and activity in the 
"sphere of influence" is the last layer that "self-interest" is a driver for.

For one to "find a reason" to think some way or do some thing is odd in the 
phrasing. Of importance more than null is the context, that which is 
comprised of the immediate spatiotemporal setting perceivable to the senses 
of the "self-interest", and the cognition from internalist mechanisms 
responsible for such things as feelings, theories, memories, and forecasts, 
such that the permutatorial proceedings of the "self-interest", the will, 
and the motivation, in ascending order of predominant influence with respect 
to one another, yields the reason as a body attached in some manner to the will 
and the motivation. The reason, after attachment in this way stated, is a 
cause for cognition or action. Finding a reason to do something could be translated 
to a matching of the context with the cause for cognition or action. But 
this translation lacks in describing the form and execution, typically in 
linear or linearizable information structures, as well as the aims of the 
activity that follows reason, equivalently the cause that has to be found 
for the aims. In the context lies the aims that, if not spatially based, must 
be forged through a metaphysical interaction. After the cause is established for 
the aims, the methodological course is produced in degrees of abstractness and 
specificities, from the "self-interest" that uses information for constructing 
this course into cognition. Meaning is important in the usage after the recollection 
of information, and meaning is attached in the form of input into motivation 
that then works with will for the recollection, out of "self-interest". Meaning is 
something out of perception, and for sentience to perceive must surely be done only 
through the will, and information from the perception is passed back through the 
"self-interest" to the units of cognition for meaning as input into motivation. The 
methodological course cannot be constructed without meaning, such construction 
done in ways of the parallels, perpendiculars, complements, variants alongside, 
and derivatives from in ways of believed compatibilities with the aims from the 
cause, the reason that was found. So, to "find a reason" is the cause to formulate 
and use a methodological course of thinking and action. The phrasing can lead 
to misconception, since to "find a feeling" is a subset of "find a reason", but 
not the converse.

The Democritean atom can be interpreted as a template with some rather 
disconcerting implications. The "self" can never be one that cannot be 
resisted, pushed, or forced in other directions strange by linear comparison. 
The "self" exists in a greater whole. From a humanist sense, the "self" is 
directly associated to a host that is a human being. Consider the "self" as 
being part of the metaphysical control system responsible for the host. To 
give full credit to the existence of equality and impact to other human beings, 
the "self" must therefore be represented as one among many other selves. 
The Democritean atom in antiquity developed to this modern day's understanding 
of the atom, one of the smallest building blocks of spatiotemporal reality, 
is associated with the phenomenon of atomic chain reactions. In short, one 
atom is connected to another atom to another in a particular arrangement, with 
little chance of there being a void in atoms where an entire subspace is 
also not void, and the split of one atom into something other radiates impact 
onto connected atoms that follow suit to their affector atom that split. The 
atomic chain reaction may be believed as natural because of contemporary 
understanding of modern reality. But to apply the Democritean atom to the 
"self" alongside other selves, metaphorically other Democritean atoms, may 
not suit certain ideologies, especially out of the freedom for chains of 
events occurring in the analogy of atomic chain reactions. There is a deterioration 
of control in these chains of events. Of noteworthy characteristic, due 
to broadness, of these chains of events is that no individual could possibly 
be responsible for maneuvering and directing the atomic chain reaction, only 
that the atomic chain reaction could start by any one individual. Perception 
changes of the "self", of any self, for this matter that is anticipated more 
often than not according to the qualities of the specific social setting, 
qualities that cannot all be directly perceived but can be derived from collation 
processed involved in perception, with varying degrees of accuracy that can 
only be proved until after the facts directly part of the prediction. Entertaining 
the analogy of atomic chain reactions in human social settings most definitely has 
gone on far before the formal discovery, through objective means by metrics of 
empirical measurement, of the atomic chain reaction phenomenon. That is the only 
plausible rationale for the longevity of some civilizations, these civilizations' 
adoption and retention of practices and constructs maladaptive or high-performing, 
despite the axiomatic nature of the atom that has been and continues to be used 
as to support one ideal modality of living, known as individualism. And so, the 
matter of narrating events on human beings, in the context of hierarchy, frequently 
produce notions on the individual as one that transcended the restrictions of their 
existence as an impactless atom, or an atom either unconnected to other atoms or 
one that is unsplittable, for then there cannot be any chain reaction started from it.

The practice of self-interest has always had a curious relationship with 
social theory. Treat the human in the way of a lone atom, call them an 
individual but do them as if they were a disconnected part from the whole, 
for what they are perceived to be after, before, or on top of the social 
theory applied onto them. Social theory is convenient for self-interest to not 
acknowledge if some conditions are satisfied. The basic physical demands, food 
and water, for the host of self-interest are met in full. Then there is the 
question of socio-economic perception of the host, according to the metrical 
comparison of expected and actual. Social theory, put into practice by a 
piecewise selection of all social theory ever conceptualized onto paper or not, is 
what is essentially the social construct. The concept that is a "social construct", 
in turn, leads to misconception of its comprehension, and obviously, through its use 
produces misconceptions. The social construct is not material. The social construct is 
perception, judgment, and behavior as practiced by the many selves in this world, 
participated in after any conception of the "self" and through movement, produces 
change for changes that are more constant than not for the constancy. And this is 
evident by the material restructurized and methodologies of the mind and body. No 
social construct can ever be wholesome, by the premise of its effects. A social 
construct produces effects in the form of spheres of influence.  Any sphere of influence 
rests inside another sphere of influence that could be the identical to the former, 
depending on the qualities of containment revolving around and intrinsic to it. And 
any sphere of influence has a fluid quality to it. Perception of a social construct 
can be objective in the detail of fact, but when preference is required, there is 
always judgment. In the social setting, the lack of axiom is for no matter that can 
be entirely of the axiom, and that is why protests of any social construct always have 
a ridiculous nature to them. To protest something is to decry or denounce by a negativity 
similar to ridiculing something, as an equating rule in judgments regarding the disapproval 
of the social construct. Ridicule is to trade perceived absurdity for another statement, 
most likely the conceptualization of the perceived absurdity which is then absurdity by 
reduction to the essence, but perhaps the conceptualization is not interpreted as absurd 
due to its accuracy of the absurdity. Nevertheless, the centrality is absurdity. 
Disapprovals of social constructs are propelled by the lack of understanding, but 
to understand something for what it is must be a process of reduction to the axioms 
known. The issue with this reduction to the axiom is that in practically all social 
matters, the reduction results in such things as gravity, oxygen, and universally 
acknowledged economic demands of body and mind, therefore falsely representing all 
social matters as essentially equal. Attaching the variable of quantity, a practice 
of an axiom, onto these matters adds more clarity. And then there are descriptors such 
as adjectives and more lengthy forms of accounting that may have their usage rest 
completely on arbitrariness. But for the sake of comprehension, every accounting 
tool of adjective or lengthier forms have references in counterpart or identity 
of medians and extremums, but with no guarantee of its correct usage by the will 
of the "self". And thus, social theory does not depend entirely on natural 
law of axioms because it is attempted understanding, depiction, and replication 
of preferences in sentient decisions and other qualities for selected 
spatiotemporal contexts. Social theory advances statements that rest on the 
preference of subjectivity. In order for the social theory to yield effects 
greater than cognitive processing of its forms of marketing such as through 
educative means, meaning the social theory necessarily has to become a fixture 
for a social construct or even become an entire social construct, certain 
statements of the social theory have to be treated as axioms, something more 
than an assumption for the convenience of no effort of proof by interaction 
or observation. But statements of social theory seldom rest on natural law, 
so cannot be axioms, certainly processed through cognition can they be 
recognized as axioms though. The intent of any social theory is to produce 
artificial axioms that may as well be axioms, always through the will can 
there be belief in the artificial axiom and designs in accordance with the 
calculated means for its success and duration in the social setting that 
is supposed to be a social construct for the social theory.

The word, as used to label the metaphysical, serves as an identifier for 
that what is labeled. There are limits in pragmatics, outside of the use 
of the word for cognitive processing, not to underestimate the effect of 
cognitive processing on the same internalist mechanisms that produces it, 
let alone the effects of cognitive processing as triggers for measurable 
biological function that may slip out of the control of the self's will, 
and for decisions as outward actions. The word then cannot be anymore than 
a medium, a symbol for interpretation. For an entire society to be able 
to think and do nothing without words is a society doomed to fail. There 
is only the translation and transcription. Where is the primal cause that 
is exactly one unit of smallest difference to the axiom? A society that 
is heavily reliant on the word cannot be advanced unless there is something 
under. The previous statement is so obvious that it means nothing for 
the pragmatics of additional development on top of the present infrastructure 
that is the utility of knowledge for the methodologies and material constructs. 
The statement could very well be spun by interpretation for words of 
analogous assortment, for meanings outside of the bluntness, perhaps 
something sharp or witty to please the humors, cracking smiles on all of 
those faces, or something that is a patronizing remark on the follies of 
introspection that could have taken many years only to miss the mark by 
many immeasurable distances. Additionally, the statement could be interpreted 
as a call to deconstruct understanding right down to the axiom, which then 
would not demand any words to be used, leaving sentient existence little 
else to do but the predominantly physical. Herein lies more issues with the 
usage of the word. The word, as used for ultimate consideration, must 
consider all span/s of possibilities, synonymously any thing that lies in 
any pair of extrema for the topic/s. Then when the time for action through 
preference is demanded, the entire span/s cannot possibly be acted on in 
full. The word is used to produce replication of understanding and awareness 
of said understanding, but as for the "self", the "self" has always been 
the one responsible for making use of the word. The "self" does not 
understand the word without the experience, and the experience cannot 
happen without the capability of the host belonging to the "self". 
Capability can be engineered outside of the control of the "self" for 
the "self". It is themes from this that helped to produced some of the 
most heartfelt literature and social dynamics, from an emotive perspective. 
To take the word as a uni-directed meaning that rests on assumptions 
through interpretation, void of consideration for the directionality 
of the will that resulted in the use, and the intended effects of that 
usage, is something personal to the "self". And the "self" that feels 
obliged to reciprocate does so in ways also perceived to be heartfelt, 
from an emotive perspective. This is subjectivity that cannot be rationally 
disputed through attempts to be objective on the immeasurable. The 
cause for the appearance and the behavior from metaphysical matters, 
such as interpretation of the word, is something that has to be taken 
in full after whatever skepticism and inquiries were conducted on the 
perception, in order for credibility of belief to persist. There is 
a gap in explanation by the word. Essentially, any interaction between 
selves produces something like an axiom, specifically an artificial 
axiom, that serves as a generality for the image of understanding 
greater than the axiom, the constant. The "self" is understood by 
others that are outside the realm of immediate perception depend 
on the word. Presumptions are constructed, expectations are demanded 
for order. Aristotelian logic used to systematize the metaphysical, 
a great part of this being the potential, of a sentient being is 
typically not subjective by intrinsic analyses. The composition of 
works in Aristotelian logic rely on the axiom, so to dissect the 
relational arrangements of these words right down the axiom, without 
the external reference, would directly result in a downward fashion 
to the axiom, the constant. There would be nothing else to question, 
only to take the work as a wholesome artificial axiom because it is 
essentially axiom. Similarly, Aristotelian logic places the word, 
outside of smallest difference to the axiom, in the way of an orientation 
alongside the counterpart words to the word. And these words cannot 
be immediately discredited in and of themselves, because every word 
is a unit for natural language, although every word could be described 
in additional words. For these words, references to them, these 
references found predominantly in the measurable spatiotemporal contexts, 
are what is required to prove that the word fits, through the 
discrimination of application. There is an innate imprecision from 
the preference of word use the "self" has to contend with, and also 
decisions of quantifying what occurs from the artificial axiom in 
the degrees of distance, metaphysical in some instances, for the 
"self" to develop its own truths, of artificial axiom, on top of 
the constants that do not always require the consideration 
of the "self", through expression by the "self" on the constants' 
existences and plausibilities. There is no centrality of the word 
that is not another word in a self-contained construct, what the 
source of expressing Aristotelian logic is, and this the "self" 
is responsible for confirmation and belief.
