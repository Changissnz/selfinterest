# Self-interest 

The uniqueness of all philosophies of self-interest are but 
a fraction of any other. In more words, that is because this 
kind of philosophy is not self-contained, instead required to 
extract and derive knowledge from other fields of the natural 
and social sciences alike, in order to put things into practice. 
Because self-interest can only be realized through personal practice, 
only the theory and the theoretics of the totality can be understood 
beforehand, and the self as a finite spatiotemporal concept can 
self-derive a petty fraction of the theory and theoretics. Specific 
fractions of the theory and theoretics are selected by the self-interested 
based on their preferences. This, in and of itself, is a form of 
prejudice. Moreover, the field of self-interest can never reach the 
fundamental low level of abstraction because it is one based on the 
utility of available choice, essentially economics in the individualistic 
sense, and the utility is always centered around the self.

The philosophy of self-interest is one that leans towards the 
private and privatization of value. Every philosopher must have 
reached their destinations in mind and body through the will, the 
fuel for self-interest to take place. Instead of fostering the language 
of general truth for the universal understanding, the philosophy of 
self-interest instead takes direction from the general truth to the 
self for the self, and also from the specific truth to that same self 
for that same self. So that is one key difference between these two 
categories of philosophers, although the philosopher that does not 
proselytize self-interest may actually be working for a collective 
interest that they think greatly benefits their self-interest. In the 
general sense, the lines involved in dualities that are then arbitrarily 
interpreted by the mind as “hard” or “soft” lines make the philosopher 
and their morality better understood by their craft of philosophy, not 
by the benefits bestowed onto them because of their craft. But one that 
is a philosopher is not strictly one of that one role.

Not to discredit the category of self-interest as a philosophy, 
but this kind of philosophy indeed serves defeatist purposes to 
the “love of wisdom", philosophy, if the assumption of “love” or 
“wisdom” having to be shared is the default requirement for a field 
to be called a class of philosophy. Self-interest also carries 
connotations of independence, liberty, and autonomy, which then 
subjects the rules and beliefs found in knowledge under the self-interested 
for their existence and decision-making. Philosophies of self-interest, 
when taught, causes the glorification of the individual. And since the 
human being arguably has a tendency to already be self-justifying, this 
tendency going all the way down to the biological immune system, there 
is a limit to how much the self can further their understanding by directly 
tending to the self by the internal means of the self. These philosophies 
cannot grow in and of themselves, only serving as backgrounds of reminder 
to encourage the individual past the general that bounds all under it.

Technical difficulties exist in the usage of natural language to explain 
philosophies of self-interest. For one thing, what is the self from one 
to another? When one thinks that their self somehow can be comprised by 
thoughts of the external, such as others’ selves, that is when the “self” 
in self-interest is no longer a direct line from the external projection 
of one to their internal workings. It is possible for one to inflate their 
notion of their self to include the lives of others, for that one to claim 
they know what is best for the other that is part of their conceptualization 
of their self, in turn morphing the understanding of self-interest as what 
suits the individual to what suits the individual and their people. Economics 
play a fundamentally great role in self-interest. If what is best for a 
specific individual is best for the common good, then what is self versus 
collective interests? Unfortunately for the language of ideals in explaining 
the interests of sentient beings, there are inevitable clashes and mergers 
between the self separated from the remaining world and the self alongside 
other selves in the same world.

Philosophies of self-interest have a murky aura in their teaching and 
interpretation. The phrasing, “murky aura”, is carefully selected to describe 
the kind of replicability and factuality in fields that desire to translate 
the subjective into the objective, that is, the formulated solution that the 
practitioner of self-interest wishes to use. This translation of the subjective 
to the objective is done primarily by the practitioner. And the teacher of 
self-interest to the student educates by means not entirely forward (murky). 
Suppose self-interest to be a vital metaphysical aspect of every being. The 
teacher has the question of putting full effort into educating the student on 
the teacher’s conceptualization of the self that is then supposed to be used 
by the student. The student, on the other hand, has the question to take as 
truth or fallacy any of the teacher’s educative statements on how they should 
nurture their own self-interest. It cannot be factually stated that only 
philosophical educations of self-interest can serve the great purpose for 
continuing legacy. Legacy is a cousin of the lone “self”, separated by degrees 
minor or major based on the lone self’s measure of accepting the historicism 
purportedly connected to them. One that proselytizes philosophy may use the 
language, poetics, and other communicative devices that give off the impression 
of no disproportional interest from their self for their self. Attempts to build 
a rational framework of expectations for students from each school of philosophy 
may very well be folly, especially in terms of self-interest, one that rests on 
the concept of “choice” more so than “obligation”.

The use of self-interest for one’s purpose always rests on systems, 
axiomatic principles pieced together for at least a metaphysical construct 
of reference. Attempting to teach another what is self-interest rests on the 
principle that can be expressed as, “do what you think or feel fit”. This 
expression uses loose wording, and opens rational-like pathways for moral 
relativism, a paradigm of thought that is not entirely confined to the truths 
of the fundamental, and is thus not at the same centrality of truth as 
fundamental philosophy that can produce the precision of science. Many will 
argue that philosophy and ethics can be one and the same, but this is a 
misconception that has led many down very regrettable roads. Here is a 
convention: there is philosophy, then mathematics, then physics, chemistry, 
and biology. Many fields past biology, then there is ethics. So those that 
claim philosophy and ethics can be one and the same must either believe that 
their view on ethics is true enough right down to the philosophical level, 
thus negating any social opposition to their view of ethics, or they must 
abide by the fundamental in expressing their views in the social context, 
this abidement granting them the liberty of not having to pose and advance 
opinion or preference as truth for the proper mannerisms of ethics. The 
default setting of self-interest being dependent on existing systems, as 
initially mentioned, means that abstract language to teach one on self-interest 
cannot start with interests of the self without the relation to something other. 
The focus on the self as an internalist construct is more so about independent 
maintenance and development, but both of these independent objectives depend 
on existing systems of methodology and material, as well. Abstracting the 
concept of the “self” for expression of these notions’ truths to another 
has shortfalls in specificities. The abstract can never capture the entire 
meaning of the “self” in a universal and thorough manner, without the “self” 
having to be the one responsible for induction to suit their specific forms 
and movements.

A posit on self-interest that cannot be proven wrong, no matter how unlike 
the fundamental truth it may be interpreted as, is that communicating to another 
a conceptualization of the “self” that they should adhere to is already at least 
one mark off from the centrality of the “self”. It is like the difference between 
any 0 and any 1; there is a space of 1 in between the two. Another posit, of a 
plausible nature, is that communication of a conceptualization of self-interest 
is not precisely about the merging of the “self” with “interest”, instead about 
the practice of self-interest, not about exactly one of the “self” or “interest”. 
The “self” should tend to their “interest”, not to something other than their 
“interest”. But there is a separation in meaning and existence between the “self” 
and the “interest”, the “interest” only being labeled this term due to factors 
that include the propensity of the “self” for it. The “self” can be influenced in 
ways, foreign to their bare state, to develop an interest for something that 
otherwise would not have occurred. Even in terms of the “self” without the 
influencer, at least a communicator if not an accepted educator, the “self” 
is not bound to a steadfast guarantee of conceptualizing their “self” in the 
same representation for all contexts. Compare notions of self-interest, these 
notions representing one or more philosophies of self-interest, with other 
abstract fields of thought. In these other fields of thought, the “self” can 
put aside their conscious conceptualization of their “self” to comprehend those 
understandings for replication or constructive utilization. But with the “self”, 
there are comprehensions of the comprehensions from the “self”, and comprehensions 
of the image projected from the “self”, and comprehensions of alternative ways of 
expression, alternative images, for the “self” to project their “self” by their 
chosen means for their wanted image.

Another origin problem, this one on self-interest. Does the “self” first have 
to learn about their “interest” through a sequence of events that is their 
experience, or through trial-and-error unintentionally finds an “interest”? 
Both of these possibilities are identical in at least half of all ways. Whether 
by chance or through the deliberation before acceptance, the “interest” becomes 
a fixation of the “self” to fulfill the “self” by acting in the manner of positive 
relation to the “interest”. In these two possibilities that comprise the whole of 
possibilities for the “self” to discover the “interest”, an interest so great the 
“self” thinks and acts in the direction of it in their belief that it is their 
“self-interest”, it may reason that the supposed randomness of trial-and-error 
and the experience are identical in outputting the same preference as discovery 
to the “self” that then embraces the preference as part of their entire self-interest. 
The phrasing of this origin problem is not merely for the humorous word play of 
differences that rest on a fundamental sameness. The fundamental sameness of 
self-interest in practice cannot be established, and concepts such as “selfishness” 
and “narcissism” are not constant associations with “self-interest”. The first 
possibility of the origin problem supposes the “self” to co-exist in the sequence 
of events. This co-existence is their experience. But in the second possibility, 
the “self” is described as a pro-active agent in the sequence of events, this 
sequence of events at least partly consisting of their choice design for the 
trial-and-error. These characteristic differences then force differing ways of 
explaining self-interest as a universal force, and practices of self-interest 
play out in various ways outside of categorization that can capture the specific 
without categorization that is specific to each specific of the specific. Validation 
of self-interest, as one or more philosophies, tend to draw connections of likeness 
between differing practices believed by the practitioners to be in the name of their 
respective self-interests, and these connections of likeness then converge to singular 
principles on what self-interest is, practices by selves that each one conducts in 
and on their respective systems.

Self-interest, a force that depends on the utility of existing systems, 
perhaps to maintain those existing systems or to improve or to abolish 
them from affecting the “self”, is something circular and most definitely 
self-serving if self-contained, coincidentally self-serving if not. But 
the quality of self-containment is not a consistent variable in outcomes, 
as a reminding note. The centrality of this concept, self-interest, almost 
instantaneously radiates outward in different practice by mass selves. 
There are unclear answers on how self-interest plays a part in socio-economic 
power dynamics, something very fundamental to human beings, frequently 
likened to “social creatures” from the antiquity of thought. To distribute 
the values of power to those in need of those values of power, to retain 
power in order to grow it and build it for the “self” above all. These 
objectives ring familiar bells on the dichotomy of control between the 
state (questionably communist) and the individual (questionably capitalist), 
a dichotomy that remains on one-sided terms if expressed only in verbal 
or written language, flimsy and lofty due to the freedom of interpretation, 
decorative because there is action for construct and then there are words 
for persuasion. These statements, on power dynamics as something the force 
of self-interest has to contend with, rather escalated quickly from the 
realm of something just above the abstract to something not quite exact 
with words, interpretation, and practice in the mass sentient setting. 
With escalations such as these, the role of self-interest as the single 
and active force is not without challenge, for practices stemming from 
fields such as control theory and decision theoretics become the foremost 
point of analysis. And through the backtracking that analyses can produce, 
perhaps self-interest can be narrowed down in the specifics of practice 
amongst its many hosts. This elaboration has at least provided some proof, 
through example, that self-interest is in fact not a self-contained field, 
due to its many outward forms that chooses existing systems to use.

## More on philosophies of self-interest #9

Philosophies of self-interest emphasize to followers principles similar 
to utilitarian ideals. The concept of “self-interest”, when put into 
practice, depends on the usage of existing systems, as already stated. 
And the essential, perhaps the only criteria uniting all that think and 
act in their way for their “self-interest”, is the utility having to be 
geared to the “interest”, done by the “self”. Utilitarian thought is almost 
entirely about the “self” co-existing in the world by acting in a way 
recognized as proper use of systems, in material or immaterial form, by 
those systems’ piecewise or holistic components. Utilitarian thought promotes 
the utility of maximizing output for the “self” given the input, the ideal 
selection/s in the candidates of systems and system components, and this 
is an integrational approach that requires sentient living to make use. 
The sentient being is obliged to be capable of learning about some material 
or skill, then putting a sort of full effort into utilizing that learned 
material or skill, and the physical expression of the sentient being as 
well as their thought generated is frequently connected to the use of 
their preferred material or immaterial system/s, a synergistic fusing, 
per se. Utilitarianism is thus quite externalist, that through what is a 
solution coinciding by construction or existence in the external, there 
is satisfaction. The paradigm also leans towards the transcendental ideals 
of sentient beings, namely human beings, being able to be one with the 
environment, for their cognition to find “happiness” and “comfort” by 
behaviors of domination of their recognized adversities through satisfying 
their recognized problems from and of their “self”. Now, on to “self-interest”. 
With “self-interest”, there is less emphasis on demanding behavior by the 
“self” to exist, in some way or form, in a “comfort zone”. The “self” pursues 
the “interest”, but this does not mean that the “self” and the “interest” 
are not already bound to one another. The “self” can self-understand as 
“self-interest”, identical in cognition. Whereas with utilitarianism, there 
are factors (happiness, et cetera) that the “self” somehow thinks are 
objectives, and thus separated from them in some way, but these objectives 
are what the “self” yearns and strives for by correcting or maintaining the 
expression of behavior in line with their route for these objectives. 
“Self-interest”, in practice, also has objectives, but the objectives do 
not magnetize the host of the “self” for the “self” to act towards them. 
A convincing statement is that “self-interest” is self-driven, propelled 
by the “self” for the “self-interest” thought of by the “self” to be their 
“self”. However, this should not be interpreted as selflessness, for as 
already defined, the “interest” of the “self” is what the “self”, itself, 
is as immortally connected to as what cannot be defined in the scientific 
terms of the material. Objectives of “self-interest” can change, while 
“self-interest” is a constant with the freedom of varying outward expression. 
“Self-interest” is governed by internalist construct, not innately governed 
by foreign metaphysical or physical forces, and is an element higher in level 
to “motivation” in the hierarchy of cognition. As for utilitarianism, the 
paradigm is a stepping stone towards the pragmatic of developing or obtaining 
solution, typically for the “self”, by conscientious observance and learning 
of the external world. And with the solution achieved, there is a satisfying 
sense in their reaching a finalistic goal, in which case, the sensible courses 
of action and thought for the utilitarian is maintenance of their state by the 
utility, required by them to be controlled by them, of the solution. Since 
“self-interest” has objectives, the satisfaction of these objectives is either 
the solution itself for the “self”, or the approach taken is the solution. 
But “self-interest” remains, and there is not a universal agreement on how 
the self-interested can evolve or form new objective. The de-emphasis of 
external reference to the concept of “self-interest”, in relation to 
utilitarianism, means that the regulatory patterns used by the “self” for 
their “self-interest” do not necessarily have to coincide with external 
material or immaterial.

Manipulative agents such as material, reactions from the material, and 
other means (“agents”, in this usage) that influence cognition become 
paramount variables differentiating the expression of one for utilitarian 
and another for their “self-interest”. The term “interest” in “self-interest” 
serves as an emphasizer on the “interest” in this concept, as something on 
top of “motivation” and tied to the “self”, for the “self” to both exist 
and operate in ways with “interest” so that an “interest” originating from 
outside the self (other selves) is not in the same lane, and there is only 
one lane for the “interest” that the “self” can pursue such that the 
“interest” is immortally connected to the “self”. In utilitarian practice, 
there is a persistent pressure to achieve an equilibrium, and out of 
pragmatism, efforts are concentrated around that stationary point reached, 
the equilibrium. “Self-interest”, on the other hand, encounters more 
incongruencies in the form of friction between the “self” tied to the 
“interest” and the situational decisions the “self” is faced with making. 
The “self”, as self-driven by their “self-interest”, has the liberty to 
modify the directionality of will for these decisions unideal, not of the 
form for a reasonable number of transformations to reach the “ideal” that 
the “self-interest” seeks. But the modification of the will by “self-interest” 
could, in turn, richochet back to the “self” as something understood as a 
pathological action, something incorrect and thus malicious against “self-interest”. 
The “self”, as an agent of their “self-interest”, acts in ways of distinctness 
to challenges that do not necessarily have to be connected to any objective 
of the “self-interest”. Utilitarian compromise of the “self” by the “self” 
taking a particular means to accomplish the objective may also be a possibility 
for the case of the “self” for “self-interest”. But compromise of the “ideal” 
by the “self” is rationalized by the self-interested as something similar to 
forced negotiation. Utilitarian thought only views compromise as forced negotiation 
when the compromise is of a relatively imposing downward force onto the “self”, 
since it is more integrationist, whereas integration could be a result of 
“self-interest” solely through the drive of the “self-interest” for that result, 
the destination. There is less of the two ends, the “self” and the solution, 
meeting half-way in initiatives by the “self” for “self-interest” than by 
utilitarian practice. Thus, utilitarian practice is typically more pre-determined 
than the self-interested in setting limits, not aspirations.

The broad field of choice is of the abstract unquantifiable not because 
of the practice of choice in the spatiotemporal setting. The spatiotemporal 
setting limits the span/s of effecting choice, and the exact degrees of 
spatiotemporal limitation is one crucial factor for the perception of 
determinism, something the self-driven “self” with their “self-interest”, 
in necessary connection to the physical host, has to cooperate with, in 
order to guard the mortality of the host. There are levels to this cooperation. 
It starts with co-existing alongside natural law, laws governing any phenomenon 
that are not subject to the will of the sentient. And then there are activities 
by sentient beings, through their physicalities stemming from natural law. 
Further along, there is the practice of non-physical interaction from sentient 
beings, with purposes such as manipulation of the will belonging to the “self” 
and socialization with the “self”. Manipulation of the will belonging to the 
“self”, to clarify, is externally sourced. Changes of the will’s directionality 
occurs through modification by the “self”’, but this modification if initialized 
by the external is manipulation. The force of “self-interest” is not bound to 
be constant or consistent in outward expression, due to the immediate span of 
choice, free from the spatiotemporal setting, for the “self”. Utilitarian 
initiatives can fall through or take detours into other initiatives. There 
is a difference in the manipulability present. “Self-interest” and utilitarianism 
are partly evident through the expression. But the “interest” to the “self” is 
of a lower level of difference than the objective/s of the “self”, due to chosen 
utility, to the “self”. The “interest” and the “self” are separate only in wording, 
in the context of “self-interest”. But with utilitarianism, there is the “self”, 
their chosen utility given their span/s of choice, and their objective. The degree 
of change in expression for the self-interested has a higher potential of difference 
to that of the utilitarian, one who thinks and acts as a subject of the spatiotemporal 
setting, although not necessarily for objectives that lie in any spatiotemporal setting. 
In manipulation, “self-interest” remains as a force but expresses by something not 
from the original, free from it, due to effects of the external’s changes of the 
will’s directionality. The self-interested that decides on being utilitarian thinks 
and acts in ways not of the original to “self-interest”, if manipulated, and thus 
fails to be utilitarian in the required identity of the original. And the utilitarian 
that is not one purely with their “self-interest” can also be manipulated, such as 
through the alterations and demands presented to them in their spatiotemporal setting, 
although the directionality of the will is still original to the “self-interest”.

## More on philosophies of self-interest #12

Philosophies of self-interest tend to overlap with studies and practices of ethics, 
due to the fact that “self-interest” is necessarily existent and then perhaps evident 
for the practice. And ethics is, as per the wisdom that the human being is a “social 
creature”, a fixture for the “social” creature of subjectivity before objectivity in 
their priorities, the fixture as analysis in the form of cross-examinations and 
introspections relatable to but not required to be related to the natural sciences, 
since sentient being’s understanding of the natural sciences bears relevance outside 
of the manuscripts and natural phenomenon as practiced by sentient beings, practices 
coinciding with natural phenomenon but differing to natural phenomenon by their sole 
association to sentient will, so will has the effecting autonomy to heed natural 
phenomenon for the “self-interest”. This last point of natural phenomenon being 
separate from sentient will is necessary not to promote arguments in duality and 
beyond. Ethics requires separability of cause-and-effect, through means arbitrary 
by reference to natural law that then governs natural phenomenon, for comprehending 
accountable human beings in accountable constructs of human beings; the term 
“accountable” could be interchanged with “responsible” due to interpretations 
from “self-interest”. The aims of ethics for the practice of the subject can be 
phrased as: the demand for satisfactory utility of the entire span of fields, from 
philosophy through the natural sciences to ethics and also past ethics in the 
application of ethics in arbitrarily structured format, this being the “law for 
human beings”.

## More on philosophies of self-interest #13

Through the lens of ethics, the thinking and actions of sentient beings can 
be what is called “judged” in the form of adjectives that carry more than 
quantitative meaning, although anything with quantitative meaning can be 
directly associated with adjectives not under the domain of quantity, so 
elaboration on this point is needed. Some examples of the thinking and actions 
of sentient beings can then be argued, in ways convincing to untamed sentiments 
of “self-interest”, moving the directionality of will for “self-interest”, to 
be adjectives such as “foolish”, “criminal”, “unruly”, and “dishonest” with 
great followings for intended results such as great grievances, great inflation 
of ego, et cetera. In a related field, there is drama, and the structurization 
of sentient activity, namely the activity of human beings, into that which elicits 
sentiment is dramatization. Without subjectivity, there can be no ethics. With 
subjectivity in the form of intense sentiment expressed in outward form by the 
will, sometimes in opposition to the directionality of origin belonging to the 
“self-interest”, ethics serves as the field that regulates through the encouragement 
of introspection alongside outward observation of case studies, in juxtaposition to 
the form the literary fields take, record and narration for the product being a 
drama from dramatization. And this is not meant to lead to assumption that ethics 
does not require recording and narration, only that the centrality of ethics is 
in regulating human behavior, by the basic internal-external duality mentioned, 
without the necessity of prescribed consequences as manifested by practices of 
“law for human beings” that use ethics as a cornerstone. The practice of ethics 
can use drama, but this particular intersection should not be confusing on the 
purpose, even though the effects of ethics and drama can converge to be one and 
the same. Orthodoxically, drama elicits, draws in cognition to produce output from 
cognition, and ethics is intended to encapsulate the comprehension of behaviors, 
represented as narrative cover or indisputable truths of phenomenon, for principles 
of thinking and behavior to be set into place, thus influencing the effects of the 
will’s directionality onto the “self” because of their “self-interest”. “Self-interest”, 
in its more outward appearances of sentient thinking and behavior, is undeniably tied 
to ethics, the connection a cause of varying doubt and conviction through the question 
for the cause of the “self-interest”.

## More on philosophies of self-interest #14 

The previous note made the claim: "without subjectivity, there can be no 
ethics". Furthering the argument in favor of this claim, a very 
well-known concept called the "sphere of influence" is used. So without 
subjectivity, there is no need for ethics because ethics is what is 
conducted by sentient will to be analyzed by sentient will, namely that 
of human beings since ethics is anthrocentric, for dualistic judgment of 
the effects from sentient will. Judgments are necessary because effects 
by sentient will are of an inferiority to the low-level correctness of the 
authentic axiom. Effects by sentient will only demand proper utility of 
whatever authentic axiom. All axioms are authentic in the scope of truth's 
judgment. However, the adjective "authentic" was derived from "axiom" and 
placed before "axiom" to emphasize the nature of the axiom, not of an 
artificial unit or any other unit that can be utilized by the will, not 
ruling the wanted effects of sentient will. The construct of a sphere of 
influence is curious with regards to the intention of axiom. One concept is 
quite clearly the prime unit of human rationale on why spheres of influences 
are formed: "self-interest". It is self-interest before collective interest, 
although the critical variable of success may be collective interest. But the 
measurable quantity of any effecting collective interest would be given a 
distortion in appearance if it was likened to a single variable in the manner 
of use for conventional algebraic expressions in mathematics. The collective, 
meaning the mass of human beings, after reaching consensus on the predominant 
initiatives, although the specific form and the specific movement of each of 
the collective does not have to coincide and only required to overlap in 
judgment of similarity, consists of individuals with self-interests that 
overlap. This phenomenon, in every case of a united collective, goes back by 
reason to how the "self" understands the "self" along with "interest" for 
their "self-interest", understanding that takes into account co-existing 
selves and self-interests. It is also through the sphere of influence that 
absurdities are believed, by those of or against the construct. Absurdities 
are the most farfetched out of the class of believable fallacies, although 
this may be reasonably put into question out of wordplay and misunderstanding 
of the word "absurdity". Another case of the technical difficulties in using 
natural language as the primary tool of explanation. "Absurd" could be "ridiculous", 
but "ridiculous" could be true, while "absurd" is less in believability than a 
"half-truth", a concept with a quantitative mark attached to describing a 
statement in truth. The question of believing a statement or body of statements 
is a decision by "self-interest" to accept only if the "self" is aligned with 
its own will in a way that can be visualized as a direct alignment between 
"self-interest", undetachable from the "self" in any conceptualization, and the 
will of the "self". The freedom to visualize is the freedom to fabricate on 
matters such as the intangible, immeasurable by most natural (biological) senses, 
and especially the immeasurable. To elaborate on a possible route of crafting 
believability of an absurdity, think of a random human being as being labeled 
an adjective, and this labeling is upheld by the sphere in the same aura as the 
believability of an axiom. From there, the sphere of influence operates in the 
manner of a mechanical system that either does not have to perform frequent 
introspection or one that does not have introspective capabilities. The human 
being is claimed to have done some particular things. Because the sphere of 
influence labeled that particular human being a specific adjective, members 
of the sphere of influence, in turn, believe the human being to have done those 
particular things, without anything close to being as real as the direct experience 
that can be recalled by cognitive instruments of healthy structure, such as human brains.

Subjectivity is a matter for cognition, with two primary bodies of 
understanding and believing it. This is a duality that adds to the 
complexity of the duality between the subjective and the objective. The 
first body is the objective that can be represented as the subjective, for 
a version of the objective that has the validity of being subject to challenge 
from sentient will or comparison with alternatives on scales selected by 
"self-interest". For something to be objective does not necessitate that something 
to be about the axiom, or for the axiom. The objective, by "self-interest", is a 
design constructed by the axiom for a wanted truth to be actualized, typically 
through perceivable action by a sentient being, and the wanted truth is not of 
the same fundamental as the axiom but something left to chance, probability with 
no absolute for one outcome, with probability that is intended to be manipulated 
for the wanted outcome/s by focus of effort on the input of said wanted outcome/s. 
Design of anything can be interpreted in the subjective by the use of "self-interest" 
operating on a will of a contrarian comparison to the design. Similarly, the term 
"style" can be used synonymously with "design". A convention for usage, however, 
is "design" is for the inanimate material structured by sentience, and "style" 
is the movement outwardly communicated by "self-interest". In both of these, 
"self-interest" determines the preference that requires satisfying of axiom/s, 
although "self-interest" does not need to acknowledge the existence or most accurate 
(by relativity) expression of the axiom. The axiom exists without usage. The axiom 
is what existence orbits around. The axiom is one among many in essence, the 
irreducible and unmanipulable core that is responsible for producing sentient 
will. Any "use" of the axiom in fact subjects one to being an agent of the axiom, 
and so any construct made by sentience first has to subject one or more sentient 
beings to represent the axiom/s. A belief is then given credit to those that uphold 
the construct, affirming the illusion that with the construct, an arbitrary number 
of axiom/s can be controlled by supercession of the construct's expression over 
arbitrary use. Truthfully, the axiom/s cannot be controlled, rather the expression 
in ways possibly more than by written or verbal communication can be controlled. 
The action because of "self-interest" is also prone to the illusion of control 
over the axiom. It is for this reason that sentient "objective" is quite often 
due entirely to the subjective, the preference by "self-interest" out of the 
will's directionality. The "objective" is not entirely predictable, outside of 
demand to sustain the physical host of "self-interest" (nutrition). Subjectivity, 
through challenge posed by "self-interest" from the will, can also be used to 
represent the axiom in non-interfering ways with the axiom. The constant existence 
of the axiom does not require recognition, in accurate forms for action from 
the axiom, from "self-interest".

The sphere of influence, being a construct that "self-interest" navigates 
and operates in, practically connected to the spatiotemporal context, has 
to be thought of as a practice by the decision of "self-interest", given 
their actionable span/s of choice. This view does assume that those capable 
of "self-interest" are not deterministic, something debatable. The ancient 
Thracian Democritus, from a long time ago, offered wisdom on the understanding 
of the world in the form of the Democritean atom, a precursor notion with 
virtually no practical application until nuclear science became formalized 
for engineering purposes in the 20th century. But for fair credit in attribution, 
it was those of the thinking along Democritus that helped continue the rationalization 
of individuality right down to the "self-interest", capable of generating the thought 
and action completely distinct from immediately neighboring self-interests of other 
selves. There cannot be much misconception from the "self" about the "self-interest" 
that affects the "self", only the host of the "self", since them two are inextricably 
connected such that the written form for the "self" is a synonym of the written form 
for the "self-interest". The objective is where "self-interest" may be undeserving 
of or misled towards. And the lack of objective exclusive to the "self" is what is 
sometimes required by the judgment of the collective, in turn expressing the self-guiding 
axiom of the "self-interest" by affecting the will, in ways such as alteration of the 
will's directionality. Here is where perception of a particular "self", this written 
use of "self" meant to consider the "self" as something observable from a third-party 
perspective, may also be influenced by the judgment of that same "self" in the paradigm 
of a particular sphere of influence. Judgments of the qualities belonging to a sphere 
of influence are by use of probabilistic means, and can be misconceived as 
absolutist or dualist due only to the specific categorical labels considered 
by judgment. "Transcendence" is a label for "spiritualistic" or "emotive" 
phenomenon that breaks out of containment, the sphere of influence or something 
directly connected to the sphere of influence, for timespans not so temporary. 
The "transcendence" is typically metaphysical when related to "self-interest" 
as a phenomenon experienced by the host of "self-interest". The containment is 
usually a mixture of the physical and the metaphysical (immeasurable cognition 
and other bodily functions belonging to the host of "self-interest") connected 
to "self-interest". It is the notion of "transcendence", something similar to 
triumph in the visual depiction of floating or soaring upwards, that is a 
cornerstone of representing the power of "self-interest" to be victorious in 
adversarial conditions. Glorifying portrayals of events, historical or entirely 
fictional, by themes such as corruption, liberation, and rebellion heavily rests 
on the abstract of floating or soaring upwards in ways obviously physical for 
the intended effects of eliciting belief that the spiritual sense likewise moves 
in the same orientation, this being the "transcendence" from the construct, 
the sphere of influence, unwanted by the "self-interest" for the "self" to 
exist in or co-exist with. The first layer of activity for the "self-interest" 
is seldom the last layer in matters of the physical, and activity in the 
"sphere of influence" is the last layer that "self-interest" is a driver for.

For one to "find a reason" to think some way or do some thing is odd in the 
phrasing. Of importance more than null is the context, that which is 
comprised of the immediate spatiotemporal setting perceivable to the senses 
of the "self-interest", and the cognition from internalist mechanisms 
responsible for such things as feelings, theories, memories, and forecasts, 
such that the permutatorial proceedings of the "self-interest", the will, 
and the motivation, in ascending order of predominant influence with respect 
to one another, yields the reason as a body attached in some manner to the will 
and the motivation. The reason, after attachment in this way stated, is a 
cause for cognition or action. Finding a reason to do something could be translated 
to a matching of the context with the cause for cognition or action. But 
this translation lacks in describing the form and execution, typically in 
linear or linearizable information structures, as well as the aims of the 
activity that follows reason, equivalently the cause that has to be found 
for the aims. In the context lies the aims that, if not spatially based, must 
be forged through a metaphysical interaction. After the cause is established for 
the aims, the methodological course is produced in degrees of abstractness and 
specificities, from the "self-interest" that uses information for constructing 
this course into cognition. Meaning is important in the usage after the recollection 
of information, and meaning is attached in the form of input into motivation 
that then works with will for the recollection, out of "self-interest". Meaning is 
something out of perception, and for sentience to perceive must surely be done only 
through the will, and information from the perception is passed back through the 
"self-interest" to the units of cognition for meaning as input into motivation. The 
methodological course cannot be constructed without meaning, such construction 
done in ways of the parallels, perpendiculars, complements, variants alongside, 
and derivatives from in ways of believed compatibilities with the aims from the 
cause, the reason that was found. So, to "find a reason" is the cause to formulate 
and use a methodological course of thinking and action. The phrasing can lead 
to misconception, since to "find a feeling" is a subset of "find a reason", but 
not the converse.

The Democritean atom can be interpreted as a template with some rather 
disconcerting implications. The "self" can never be one that cannot be 
resisted, pushed, or forced in other directions strange by linear comparison. 
The "self" exists in a greater whole. From a humanist sense, the "self" is 
directly associated to a host that is a human being. Consider the "self" as 
being part of the metaphysical control system responsible for the host. To 
give full credit to the existence of equality and impact to other human beings, 
the "self" must therefore be represented as one among many other selves. 
The Democritean atom in antiquity developed to this modern day's understanding 
of the atom, one of the smallest building blocks of spatiotemporal reality, 
is associated with the phenomenon of atomic chain reactions. In short, one 
atom is connected to another atom to another in a particular arrangement, with 
little chance of there being a void in atoms where an entire subspace is 
also not void, and the split of one atom into something other radiates impact 
onto connected atoms that follow suit to their affector atom that split. The 
atomic chain reaction may be believed as natural because of contemporary 
understanding of modern reality. But to apply the Democritean atom to the 
"self" alongside other selves, metaphorically other Democritean atoms, may 
not suit certain ideologies, especially out of the freedom for chains of 
events occurring in the analogy of atomic chain reactions. There is a deterioration 
of control in these chains of events. Of noteworthy characteristic, due 
to broadness, of these chains of events is that no individual could possibly 
be responsible for maneuvering and directing the atomic chain reaction, only 
that the atomic chain reaction could start by any one individual. Perception 
changes of the "self", of any self, for this matter that is anticipated more 
often than not according to the qualities of the specific social setting, 
qualities that cannot all be directly perceived but can be derived from collation 
processed involved in perception, with varying degrees of accuracy that can 
only be proved until after the facts directly part of the prediction. Entertaining 
the analogy of atomic chain reactions in human social settings most definitely has 
gone on far before the formal discovery, through objective means by metrics of 
empirical measurement, of the atomic chain reaction phenomenon. That is the only 
plausible rationale for the longevity of some civilizations, these civilizations' 
adoption and retention of practices and constructs maladaptive or high-performing, 
despite the axiomatic nature of the atom that has been and continues to be used 
as to support one ideal modality of living, known as individualism. And so, the 
matter of narrating events on human beings, in the context of hierarchy, frequently 
produce notions on the individual as one that transcended the restrictions of their 
existence as an impactless atom, or an atom either unconnected to other atoms or 
one that is unsplittable, for then there cannot be any chain reaction started from it.

The practice of self-interest always had and has a curious relationship with 
social theory. Treat the human in the way of a lone atom, call them an 
individual but do them as if they were a disconnected part from the whole, 
for what they are perceived to be after, before, or on top of the social 
theory applied onto them. Social theory is convenient for self-interest to not 
acknowledge if some conditions are satisfied. The basic physical demands, food 
and water, for the host of self-interest are met in full. Then there is the 
question of socio-economic perception of the host, according to the metrical 
comparison of expected and actual. Social theory, put into practice by a 
piecewise selection of all social theory ever conceptualized onto paper or not, is 
what is essentially the social construct. The concept that is a "social construct", 
in turn, leads to misconception of its comprehension, and obviously, through its use 
produces misconceptions. The social construct is not material. The social construct is 
perception, judgment, and behavior as practiced by the many selves in this world, 
participated in after any conception of the "self" and through movement, produces 
change for changes that are more constant than not for the constancy. And this is 
evident by the material restructurized and methodologies of the mind and body. No 
social construct can ever be wholesome, by the premise of its effects. A social 
construct produces effects in the form of spheres of influence.  Any sphere of influence 
rests inside another sphere of influence that could be the identical to the former, 
depending on the qualities of containment revolving around and intrinsic to it. And 
any sphere of influence has a fluid quality to it. Perception of a social construct 
can be objective in the detail of fact, but when preference is required, there is 
always judgment. In the social setting, the lack of axiom is for no matter that can 
be entirely of the axiom, and that is why protests of any social construct always have 
a ridiculous nature to them. To protest something is to decry or denounce by a negativity 
similar to ridiculing something, as an equating rule in judgments regarding the disapproval 
of the social construct. Ridicule is to trade perceived absurdity for another statement, 
most likely the conceptualization of the perceived absurdity which is then absurdity by 
reduction to the essence, but perhaps the conceptualization is not interpreted as absurd 
due to its accuracy of the absurdity. Nevertheless, the centrality is absurdity. 
Disapprovals of social constructs are propelled by the lack of understanding, but 
to understand something for what it is must be a process of reduction to the axioms 
known. The issue with this reduction to the axiom is that in practically all social 
matters, the reduction results in such things as gravity, oxygen, and universally 
acknowledged economic demands of body and mind, therefore falsely representing all 
social matters as essentially equal. Attaching the variable of quantity, a practice 
of an axiom, onto these matters adds more clarity. And then there are descriptors such 
as adjectives and more lengthy forms of accounting that may have their usage rest 
completely on arbitrariness. But for the sake of comprehension, every accounting 
tool of adjective or lengthier forms have references in counterpart or identity 
of medians and extremums, but with no guarantee of its correct usage by the will 
of the "self". And thus, social theory does not depend entirely on natural 
law of axioms because it is attempted understanding, depiction, and replication 
of preferences in sentient decisions and other qualities for selected 
spatiotemporal contexts. Social theory advances statements that rest on the 
preference of subjectivity. In order for the social theory to yield effects 
greater than cognitive processing of its forms of marketing such as through 
educative means, meaning the social theory necessarily has to become a fixture 
for a social construct or even become an entire social construct, certain 
statements of the social theory have to be treated as axioms, something more 
than an assumption for the convenience of no effort of proof by interaction 
or observation. But statements of social theory seldom rest on natural law, 
so cannot be axioms, certainly processed through cognition can they be 
recognized as axioms though. The intent of any social theory is to produce 
artificial axioms that may as well be axioms, always through the will can 
there be belief in the artificial axiom and designs in accordance with the 
calculated means for its success and duration in the social setting that 
is supposed to be a social construct for the social theory.

The word, as used to label the metaphysical, serves as an identifier for 
that what is labeled. There are limits in pragmatics, outside of the use 
of the word for cognitive processing, not to underestimate the effect of 
cognitive processing on the same internalist mechanisms that produces it, 
let alone the effects of cognitive processing as triggers for measurable 
biological function that may slip out of the control of the self's will, 
and for decisions as outward actions. The word then cannot be anymore than 
a medium, a symbol for interpretation. For an entire society to be able 
to think and do nothing without words is a society doomed to fail. There 
is only the translation and transcription. Where is the primal cause that 
is exactly one unit of smallest difference to the axiom? A society that 
is heavily reliant on the word cannot be advanced unless there is something 
under. The previous statement is so obvious that it means nothing for 
the pragmatics of additional development on top of the present infrastructure 
that is the utility of knowledge for the methodologies and material constructs. 
The statement could very well be spun by interpretation for words of 
analogous assortment, for meanings outside of the bluntness, perhaps 
something sharp or witty to please the humors, cracking smiles on all of 
those faces, or something that is a patronizing remark on the follies of 
introspection that could have taken many years only to miss the mark by 
many immeasurable distances. Additionally, the statement could be interpreted 
as a call to deconstruct understanding right down to the axiom, which then 
would not demand any words to be used, leaving sentient existence little 
else to do but the predominantly physical. Herein lies more issues with the 
usage of the word. The word, as used for ultimate consideration, must 
consider all span/s of possibilities, synonymously any thing that lies in 
any pair of extrema for the topic/s. Then when the time for action through 
preference is demanded, this being how the will of the sentient shows itself, 
the entire span/s cannot possibly be acted on in full. The word is used to 
produce replication of understanding and awareness of said understanding, 
but as for the "self", the "self" has always been the one responsible 
for making use of the word. The "self" does not understand the word without 
the experience, and the experience cannot happen without the capability 
of the host belonging to the "self". Capability can be engineered outside 
of the control of the "self" for the "self". It is themes from this that 
helped to produced some of the most heartfelt literature and social 
dynamics, from an emotive perspective. To take the word as a uni-directed 
meaning that rests on assumptions through interpretation, void of 
consideration for the directionality of the will that resulted in 
the use, and the intended effects of that usage, is something personal 
to the "self". And the "self" that feels obliged to reciprocate does 
so in ways also perceived to be heartfelt, from an emotive perspective. 
This is subjectivity that cannot be rationally disputed through 
attempts to be objective on the immeasurable. The cause for the 
appearance and the behavior from metaphysical matters, such as 
interpretation of the word, is something that has to be taken in 
full after whatever skepticism and inquiries were conducted on the 
perception, in order for credibility of belief to persist. There is 
a gap in explanation by the word. Essentially, any interaction between 
selves produces something like an axiom, specifically an artificial 
axiom, that serves as a generality for the image of understanding 
greater than the axiom, the constant. The "self" is understood, 
through use of the word, by others outside the realm of immediate 
perception. Presumptions are constructed, expectations are demanded 
for order. Aristotelian logic used to systematize the metaphysical, 
a great part of this being the potential, of a sentient being is 
typically not subjective by intrinsic analyses. The composition of 
works in Aristotelian logic rely on the axiom, so to dissect the 
relational arrangements of these words, without the external 
reference, would directly result in a downward fashion to the 
axiom, the constant. There would be nothing else to question, 
only to take the work as a wholesome artificial axiom because it is 
essentially axiom. Similarly, Aristotelian logic places the word, 
outside of smallest difference to the axiom, in the way of an orientation 
alongside the counterpart words to the word. And these words cannot 
be immediately discredited in and of themselves, because every word 
is a unit for natural language, the consensus for the mapping of 
sound or concatenated writing strokes to meaning, although 
every word could be described in additional words. For these words, 
references to them, these references found predominantly in the 
measurable spatiotemporal contexts, are what is required to prove 
that the word fits, through the discrimination of application. 
There is an innate imprecision from the preference of word use 
the "self" has to contend with, and also decisions of quantifying 
what occurs from the declared artificial axiom, necessarily 
constructed beforehand, in the degrees of distance, metaphysical 
in some instances, for the "self" to develop their own truths, 
of artificial axiom, on top of the constants that do not always 
require the consideration of the "self", through expression 
by the "self" on the constants' existences and plausibilities. There 
is no centrality of the word that is not another word in a self-contained 
construct, what the source of the expressing of Aristotelian logic 
originally is without application, and this places responsibility 
onto the "self" for confirmation and belief through their own 
application.

A major misconception is that individualism is a Western thing, 
collectivism an Eastern thing. That is how some concepts are 
explained in the basic sense. In practically every nation, there 
are icons that are human, not necessarily elevated to anything equal to a 
demi-god or beyond. Every icon is an individual, so every nation 
practices individualism to a certain extent. The strict dichotomy 
is probably necessary to an extent, on top of the existing translation 
issues, due to there existing additional considerations besides from the 
elevation of the individual to the status of icon, as requirements 
for individualism to be present. Then the discussion entirely 
turns into many topics, with social theory sitting somewhere on top. 
Human societies of various ideologies "make their people", as confusing 
as the quotation sounds. A human being is born, but then has to 
be made by their people? The quotation effects changes onto 
self-interest. The quotation, when enmeshed into social 
decision-making, from human being to human being, that is, 
originally drives self-interest in degrees of changing directionalities 
and magnitudes. The will remains the same though, as clarification, 
despite what involvement of the practice of "make their people". 
Individualism is not always what self-interest is geared to, 
but it happens for some reasons more often in certain regions 
only due to the acceptance of the challenge the individual poses, 
in other regions a continuation of informatic projection (that 
is what legacy is a part of). For reasons stemming from the 
dichotomy that must be implicit by generational design, with 
the freedom by self-interest to explicitly structure and describe 
for promoting others' understandings through those courses, 
social and cultural studies are infinite in discussion by the 
variance of the pertaining information on different peoples 
having distinction yet equality, through the explicit mention, 
while the localities of the practices are also unique. To elaborate, 
it is as if one were to ask 1000 absolutely illiterate but compliant 
people how they would write the number 7. There would be at least 
one way, and goes all the way up to 1000. And that is only the 
initial decision that each illiterate person makes. There are 
many variables besides from writing the number 7 that serve as 
topics of such great variance. Regarding the question of compatibilities, 
no two human beings could possibly turn adversarial against each 
other if both were tasked with finding out as much about one another 
based on their roots, their heritage, their present and prior experience 
on the penalty of unwanted death for their failure through deliberate 
inadequacy or incompetence. Peace would need to be maintained, until the 
job is done for one or both. Another peculiar aspect on social and cultural 
studies is observing how the individual adapts to a changing world, the 
changes very incongruent and not so cleanly cut based on geographic 
area. Also in this aspect, so many articles could be written on 
this as a lone topic that entire libraries would be filled up with 
nothing but similarities and differences, in the context of localities 
and globalities, through the accounting of the individual and the 
individual's collective. There always seems to be expectations for 
the individual, despite what collectivist policy and arrangements 
have or were put into place to involve them. Just as types such 
as misers and vengeance seekers gain a lot of gratification through 
the suffering of select others, the breaking of the collective 
or individual expectation has a proportional degree of emotive 
energy elicited, frequently hysterical and demented when the 
top and only paradigm is determinism. For these matters, there 
seldom are answers adequate enough to fulfill perceived inadequacies 
of empirical accounting, scientific, mathematical, narrative, et 
cetera, and perhaps even the explanation from religious/political 
authorities also falls short of quelling the perceived hurt from 
expectations unmet. Whatever the explanations, the explanations either 
depend on the use of or rest on the existence of the will. For some 
things failed or unmet, that would be the doing of the will, much 
to the chagrin of certain self-interests. When there are mysteries 
in human decision-making or the material constructs that humans produce 
to eventually crumble, the remaining mystery irreducible to any more 
detail or infinitesimal material is caused by the will. That is 
where the will comes into underlying play. The ideal can be dichotomized 
into individual and the collective. The individual that lives in the 
same image before their experience of the ideal must be deluded. 
Expectations can never be met according to the self-interest of 
sternness in comparing the actual with the ideal. The actual is more 
experience of default arbitrariness than what the ideal is portrayed 
as, and so, must require the correct directionalities of the will 
for the self-interest in order to be satisfactory to self-interest, 
outside of the reference to their conceptualization of the ideal. 
In another possibility for understanding what the individual and 
the collective really mean, there are the cases of individuals, 
despite in what society they lived in, to become resolved to their 
"own path", withdrawing themselves to a reliance on remembering 
the actuality they have come to believe through their experience 
of the actual, before paying their attention to any image of ideal. 
From a rubric that considers these individuals' cognitive states, 
the individuals would be individualist. But the collective can 
represent these individuals as collectivists, in order to maintain 
the notion that said individuals have been fully integrated in 
the scope of behavior and attitudes. So there are things not mentioned 
about the individual, in individualistic or collectivistic settings. 
In certain realities that have produced literary works that reflect 
back on those realities, some noteworthy dynamics serve as astute 
examples of the troubles underneath clean-cut dichotomies. There 
is the guard as the tormentor, or the guard as the traitor, when 
the guard is an individual designated to act for a collectivistic 
interest. But seemingly out of nowhere, the guard, out of his own 
greed and desires foreign to those he is supposed to guard, proceeds 
on a different economical route of compromise to what is ordered to him 
to be the fixture, as per the duties declared onto him the guard. 
The male pronoun is used for the reason of the male being the 
predominant gender in physical security arrangements. But in a 
parallel way, human females can do no better. And in the nationalist 
context, there is the jealous neighbor, the terrible town bullies, 
and then the foreigners as the secret admirers and worshippers of 
that specific individual, supposed to always be regarded as an 
icon, as long as the practice of history goes on. Dynamics such as 
these show the unexpected that believed loyalties can result in 
with just the right kind of flux. Self-interest means nothing in 
some places, supposedly in hyper-collectivist or anti-individualist 
arrangements; it is the will that is responsible. And this nullification 
cannot be summarized with just these two labels, "hyper-collectivist" 
and "anti-individualist", without there being dishonesty. Something 
the individual with their self-interest, dependent on their will, 
contemplates either rationally or emotively, at least every so often.

Human beings can be the most insulting there are. There is no way 
around this statement if considered in the holistic sense. For 
statements that become reasons such as the one two sentences 
back, the "self" develops certain behaviors in thinking and action 
based on the experience. The host of the "self", upon belief that their 
siblings have been informing on them to the police to keep them broke 
and terrorized, has other notions of blood. The host of the "self", 
upon believing that they have been treated like a lab rat for lethal 
poisons and viruses, places less faith in doctors. The host of the 
"self", after believing that their internet activity has been sold 
by their own government to foreign political organizations, becomes 
a Luddite. The host of the "self", upon being discovered by their elders 
of their seeking independence, gets their belongings confiscated 
and labeled a handicapped and crippled piece of trash by their welfare 
system. The "self" remains with the host after the host is let down 
and set back by the collective. Perhaps that is the most important 
merit for the preference of individualism over collectivism. What 
the human being, as a "social creature", does is meddle and inform, 
at best, if their skills and expertise are not called for. It is 
the experience from human being to human being that produces pathological 
hate for the human, that is what misanthropy is. All cravings of blood 
not for the meal are part of this long-lasting emotive body. The collective 
is not a mechanical system from the start. It is not even entirely organic. 
Through the propensities of the appearance of the human being, leanings 
become careers and institutions. Women easy on the eyes aim to become 
whores for the sons of aristocrats. Men of unusual size and strength 
become icons in big sports. These are merely two examples and they 
focus entirely on the physical appearance, but through them, the reader 
can very well gather, by recollection of their own experience, how 
the humanities portray things and what really goes on in socio-economic 
policy, with appearances, talents, and governance. Human beings can 
also be the most helpless, without institutions backing their wars 
and deceptions. Individuals become slaves before knowing it, from the 
perspective of psychological acknowledgment. Ultimately, to become upset 
over another human being's loss is something else outside of the procedures 
and status, despite what reason for their loss. To adhere to a social 
system that was designed by human beings, but to somehow have issues 
with the system at specific points in time?

Sentient intelligence is a social value in practice. It cannot 
be anything more without relation to other intelligences. There would 
only be actions and products initiated by sentient intelligence, but 
the actions and products would merely have occurred or exist as a 
change onto the physical world. One way to counter the previous 
statement is promoting the notion of the "self" actually being 
"self-referential" and "self-justifying" without immunity, but only 
through the lack of social settings capable of producing challenge in 
physical or psychological form can this notion be accepted without the 
longest and most thoughtful intellectual conversations in the whole entire 
galaxy. Intelligence is a value that, with training and application, becomes 
refined in the way of metalworking products, but intelligence is not entirely 
metal. Intelligence becomes the worst thing for sociability when the sentient 
being has to dedicate virtually all of their efforts to develop the works 
of their intelligence for propagation, whereas competitors in socio-economically 
comfortable positions can simply censor them according to the respective 
construct of prescribed power. These situations must be in the manner of mind 
slavery for others, in the economic dogma of capitalism where both time and 
emotions can somehow be quantified into money for the money. The products of 
intelligence can be replicated, a statement that goes against the whole "knowledge 
is power" axiom (very questionably), since as already stated, sentient intelligence 
is a social value and requires relations to the external world to exist in 
practice of effects with other sentience, and thoughts can be transcribed onto 
paper and/or machine with a relative degree of inaccuracy, however the idea and 
the formulae still become present in material form. The knowledge economy is 
governed by knowledge authorities. That is the structure that self-interest 
must navigate in order to extract gold, metaphysical or not, from the knowledge 
economy, hopefully netting something before becoming too demoralized to 
continue the high road of thought, instead having to resort to the practice, 
borne from "schools" of pragmatics, as if that resort ever blindly turned 
an eye to subjective mistakes in the same leniency as the intellectual 
sphere. There is a relation between knowledge and power, sure. The relation 
is that knowledge can be both a precursor for obtaining victory for power, 
and knowledge can also be produced from the power of accurate cognitive 
direction in problem-solving. This, as a reminder, does not mean that 
knowledge is power, only somewhere in the equation. The understanding 
of power typically adopts the forms of broad concepts first, then 
becomes implemented into the specificities of decorum belonging to 
human beings under that power. As an example of why knowledge and power 
is not one and the same, memorize this scenario. A human being, out 
of their self-interest, believes in sharing and promoting certain 
knowledges, as a testament to their goodwill, only to get shot in 
the face. Moral relativism exists in this scenario if and only if 
the "self" were to remain impartial, thereby granting them the cognitive 
freedom, out of their will not steadfast in directionality, to think 
whatever of the event at any point in time or space during their 
host's remaining existence. Here is another example. The authorities 
demand a human being use their brain to produce some work, as part of 
social responsibility to the public. The human being refuses, escapes, 
and joins a revolt. What kind of intelligence is needed then of them that 
does not also require "chance"? And what kind of changes would that 
intelligence produce? The human being only wanted to be left alone. 
Curiosity closed on the question of demands prescribed by the socially 
responsible onto sentient intelligence, sentient intelligence is a social 
value. Intellectual purity is a myth. At best, there is creativity original 
by the lack of immediate reference, first buried before being cherished by 
those that no longer have the inconvenience of having to think those thoughts 
into material form for society, the collective, or whatever. There is 
already one copy. Then there are institutions for regulatory bureaucracy 
and big business. What is really the "self" in civilization, with 
the potential to not have to hunt or farm for a living?

The philosophy and the living justify and reinforce each other through 
symbiotic ties for introspection, application, validation, and evolution. 
Just as numbers cannot be invented, but the mathematical sciences contain 
inventions used to rationalize meanings about numbers, the practice of 
philosophy has never produced "pure reason", that is reason without 
exemplifying statement, reason that is pure truth as an operation and operator, 
a systematic rationalizer greater in quality than the boolean. Philosophy, 
past the rudimentary of the axiom that is unable to be produced and only 
discoverable or re-discoverable and the empiricism of the natural world, 
becomes split by perspectives. Each perspective of noteworthy interest is 
required to argue for non-axiomatic statements of a questionable truthfulness. 
Certain schools of philosophies promote the idea of some universal thing that is 
more elaborate than the axiom, yet just as grounded in principle and 
intrinsic provability as the axiom. But these promotions do, in fact, 
require believers since quite frequently, only through approved behaviorial 
approaches can some of these universal ideals be accomplished according 
to what is deemed right. And some behaviors are intentionally rehearsed 
by the "self" for what the "self" believes is for the right ideal or whatever. 
The "self" has the freedom to focus entirely on the "way of living" in order 
to practice the wanted philosophy. Such emphasis on the practice, the "way of 
living", over acquiring full memory and awareness of the essence of the philosophy 
through more formal ways, is quite common for areas in which the written word 
does not have a strong mark in pushing the student of that particular philosophy.
The written word is more of an introductory reference, a note that remains in 
case of the school's upheaval. The written word simple does not have the adequacy 
of expressing formulated effective methodologies for all cases of the generic 
problem/s the philosophy is designed to solve for. Preference for the independence 
of "practicing" over "studying" the philosophy carries an implication. The "self" 
is not so much intent on the "love of wisdom" as they are on reaping as much 
benefit from their own personal use of the specific philosophy they practice. 
Self-interest takes precedence as the source of objective for the "self" in 
either the preference of the "practice" or the "study". But the "practice" 
clearly focuses more on gains for the "self" as a living agent, forced to take 
up practices of one or more way/s of life to achieve some wanted existential 
state. The "study", on the other hand, is for the understanding of 
the "follower", serving as a metric for how well the follower has integrated 
themself amongst their peers in the same school of philosophy. The practitioner 
focuses more on their own progress, and all else being equal to the student, 
sees the improvements in their way of living as indicative of the power of 
their chosen philosophy. The student, with their strict observance of the 
philosophy's axioms, does not place as much value on the application, for in 
their puritanical perspective, any practice perfected relies on the trueness 
of the axioms relied upon. All perfected practices are perfect by their performances' 
reference, but not all systematic bodies of thought carry the same quality. 
The student and the practitioner seldom are completely distinct in their 
approach to the same philosophy. But the potentials of the 
student and that of the practictioner eventually diverge to produce two 
different kinds of characters. The student becomes a teacher of their craft, and 
the practitioner a master of their living. By some unclear dynamics through the 
means utilized, the practitioner that has achieved mastery may, in turn, be a 
poor teacher of the very philosophy they mastered. The emphasis they place 
on mastering the ways outside of the philosophy's official forms grants them 
the advantage of greater performance through unorthodox knowledge acquired through 
the personal experience. But the greater performance is strongly associated with 
the practitioner's identity, and not entirely with the philosophical prescriptions 
they were supposed to adhere to as devoted students of the school. In the extreme 
cases, the practitioner aims for their self-empowerment, for power in excess by 
relativistic comparison, and the student after becoming a teacher also becomes 
more dogmatic, loyal to the foundational principles that they were educated 
under.

The self understands the world by their own references of knowledge and 
belief. Through the will, self-interest makes the determination, seemingly 
arbitrary from the perspective of others, of the centralities of perception, 
and the will of the self stands by those recognized centralities. The 
centralities consist of those topics the self recognizes as most essential 
to their understanding of the world. Without one centrality, it is as if an 
entire column of reality somehow lacks the support to continue making sense 
to the self. Confidence is eroded, and the self is left to wonder how their 
personally recognized centrality could possibly be replaced with something 
else similar to an immoveable axiom, the only way to restore sense and order 
to something that has become so outlandish without the support of their 
recognized centrality. Without the centrality, the reference to a source 
could be perceived as the source, and both the reference and source could 
be misidentified as extraneous variables. Understanding would not take the 
form proper to that which involves the self's chosen centrality. There become 
more ways to understand, due to more pathways unleashed by the lack of structure 
the centrality would have granted. Minor sidelines become the focus, the epicenter 
of meaning seemingly caves in from the self's perception as the self's comprehending 
processes rest on fundamentally different centralities, including the visual foci. 
What the self chooses to share with other selves is always a fraction of what 
truths the self believes in. There is no way for anything more than that fraction: 
besides from the required effort the self needs to expend to make for fuller and 
fuller explanations, the self has a need to guard beliefs and facts that would 
be disadvantageous to them if revealed to the other. To complicate the matter 
of the self's worldview, a collation of information operating in flux to produce 
multiple images for understanding, based so heavily on the self's recognized 
centralities, the self dons dualist mechanisms of behaviorial expression and 
cognitive processing. In virtually all cases, the self dons this duality and 
seeks to minimize as much opportunity for the other to know the characteristics 
of the duality in full. The self projects information in uni-directed modalities 
of comprehension, as to give the impression of a steadfast conviction in belief. 
The self retains dualist mechanisms for achieving completeness of the ways and 
forms, at the expense of the traits of  purity and singularity that are oftentimes 
recognized as the most genuine marks of honesty and goodwill. Duality, in 
historical use by human beings, serves as an overarching symptom of an immune system 
that operates on the ruthlessness of pragmatism, but could certainly be described 
in the idealistic terms of what is the predominant and what should be kept in 
reserve just in case. Duality compensates for the weakness of ideological purity, 
goes the thinking of many that adopt dualist tendencies into their modus operandi. 
By the phrase "weakness of ideological purity", take the phrase to mean the implicit 
restraints placed onto the self, whether due to the certain principles or lack of 
principles associated with the ideology's practice. The self that decides on using 
dualist mechanisms still intends to think and act as one in the whole, not one 
split in two ways by two halves. The robustness in behavior that the self seeks 
in duality is a result of the will driving self-interest. The pragmatics of 
compensation is a choice to go down the route of impurity, with the promise of 
achieving more and retaining more only due to the greater appreciation of ways 
and forms anti-thetical to one another, but together produces a self dynamic beyond 
the predictability of purity. The self has many issues to contemplate and handle, 
from a cognitive perspective, in dualist modus operandi. The will is what gives 
reminder to the self about their identity, a part of their self-interest. The 
will is what energizes the self to find difference in others' similar dualist 
tendencies, while for the self, their self-interest is self-justifying of their 
dualism. 

## More on philosophies of self-interest #26 

Self-interest has many attributes, not even of a constant number, variable to 
the whims of the self's will and the necessitated demands of the spatiotemporal 
context. Recognizing a thing, out of possible candidates, as a centrality is a 
preference for the self. Using dualist thought and behavior is a pragmatic choice. 
These two principles, of choosing centrality/ies and donning duality, no longer 
become generalizable to any self after the self puts them into their own existential 
practice. Using these two principles, the self is able to be their own ultimate 
agent in the acceptance and rejection of outcome. This is different from the 
statement that the self alone bears the expectation of succeeding or failing at 
any arbitrarily-defined task. Given the hindrances posed by some spatiotemporal 
circumstances, it would be reasonably foolish to expect one to be able to succeed 
at some task. But human beings seldom demand others to do things only because the 
demands are reasonable. On the contrary, the great prospect of watching a human 
being fail at something due to the odds stacked against them is what gives some 
adversaries sheer satisfaction in being witness to that specific kind of failure, 
typically also narrated back to the audience as foolhardy and hubristic. When the 
self becomes capable of exercising their own acceptance and rejection of outcomes, based 
on the centralities that they use in comprehension and judgment, and on the styles 
of expression in transparency or dishonesty by their dualist modus operandi, the 
self has a form of control unacquirable by others, yet this control is still vulnerable 
enough to be manipulable against their self-interest. Incorporating dualist mechanisms 
and finding new centralities still do not guarantee the self to become an independent 
agent, even when the question of such basics as food,water, and shelter are not 
part of the consideration. Unfortunately for those bent on achieving independence 
for themselves, there are no easy formulae to use for that objective, although many 
cases of achieving independence rely on certain staples obvious enough for there 
not be any need to explicitly mention. When the self relies on another, there are 
some rather predictable routes for outcomes. In the first two routes, the other 
assumes a regulatory/oversight role of hierarchical power over the self. The other 
could make "correct" use of a pertaining system to aid in judgments, recommendations, 
and other advice for the self. The other could also make "incorrect" use of a pertaining 
system, through discriminatory practices of misapplication and/or preferential 
application of system functions belonging to a system that otherwise is based on 
impeccable principle (but those impeccable principles are safeguards for nothing, as 
it turns out in some cases). In the third route, the other plays along by taking an 
auxiliary (secondary) role as a helper to the self. The self has a balancing problem 
to deal with in their involvement of an other into their efforts. The self believes 
themself to be inadequate, usually by spatiotemporal metrics, to accomplishing 
objectives that require as much scale as they do perfection. The self can reach a level 
of perfection, but the perfection is granular, constrained to orbit around the lone 
source, the self. By involving others, the self has to make due with possible lessening 
in quality and contentious/mixed agenda, such as collusion, favoritism, hyper-competition, 
and non-independence. In arrangements of relativity, the self can always be made out 
(conceptualized, narrated about) to be wrong, foolish, et cetera, by the other's use of 
statements that employ opinion while being fronted by illusion of fact. The self uses 
systems by their own strengths and preferences, and another self likewise but with the 
freedom to not be identical in use. As such, the same system when used differently is 
an antinomy between any two users of distinct styles and preferences. And that is in 
regards to only one system. The self becomes one forced to compromise for the greater 
ideal, when the self can do no things declared important without other accomplices. 
Compromise does not quite negate the innate righteousness of the self in their preferences. 
The self, being one with their self-interest above all, this so-called greater ideal, 
sees fault first in others, considers their self as first in the line of consideration, 
and is seldom not the last to admit fault. Admission of fault rarely ever makes sense 
to the self that knows the world can turn hostile against them very quickly, despite 
of what reason. The self, regardless of their cooperation with others, is a hypocrite 
after taking up dualist principles. From a singularist perspective, there is no need 
for duality except for dealing with conflicts of systemic inconsistency and hierarchy 
from the other, and the self knows how to state this in countless ways out of their 
self-interest.

What separates the force of self-interest from the practice of pragmatics is the 
fundamental ground of operation. Pragmatics is merely a body, of indeterminate 
size, of relational principles (non-axiomatic in other words) for use as a framework 
in decision-making. Thus, the pragmatic person may have habitually developed their 
pragmatism to encompass traits such as stoicism, mindfulness in calculation, and 
avoidance of endeavors recognized as vain and deluded, yet their pragmatism, being 
an outward practice of expression based on relational principles learned to aid in 
decisions of specific spatiotemporal circumstances, cannot be a part of their 
essential existence. This is in stark contrast to the force of self-interest, 
propelled by the will, for what the host believes is for their own good, the 
good oscillating somewhere between desiring for the gains of the collective 
and the gains of the self, as an indisputable form of selfishness. The host, 
by their self-interest, that vital force inseparable from sentience until death 
does them part, always has the option to take the pragmatic path, given the 
condition that the host knows what it means to be essentially pragmatic, 
instead of making decisions that coincide with increasing the chances of their 
survival. The pragmatist tends to be an informed decision-maker, so a human 
being that relies on coincidence to obtain their best possible decision simply 
cannot be pragmatic due to the chance that they never put any thought or practice 
into controlling for their self-interest. Those that act by their self-interest 
are not obliged to act pragmatically, for self-interest is a force that is a 
primary driver of what is arguably "free will" for human beings, naturally granting 
human beings the liberty to fight at great costs for their ideals that are 
coincidentally contrarian to orthodox pragmatic practices. The potential of 
achievements through pragmatism revolves around mastery of the relative and the 
relation. For instance, those that operate purely by their self-interest may 
find themselves lost for direction that yields them gain. Instead of gain, there 
is loss due to over-consumption, oversensuality, and miscomprehension of the 
abstract and noble ideal when the ideal is put into objective form. These errors
in decision-making are common for those that do not have the experience of 
contemplating their intrinsic weaknesses that cannot be resolved or ignored 
through efforts in the same direction, based on the directionality of their will 
in charge of advancing their self-interest. The individual, with their self-interest, 
may fall prey to their whim fostered by a will blind to the risks of their being 
deluded by their ideals. Self-interest, then, cannot be a sole determining force 
for a human being to understand what their long-term interests of gains are. Within 
this force of self-interest contains the irrationality of passion and personal 
belief. Without the guidance of pragmatic thought, those by their own self-interest 
can only learn the better path through first experiencing costly mistakes, and 
many of these mistakes cannot be rewinded back to the starting point before the 
costs have inflicted themselves in the manner of permanence. Pragmatism allows the 
self the opportunity to understand the means, in abstract and technical forms, 
that would allow them the greatest probabilities of achieving their vision, their 
ideal, through the emphasis on choosing the best relative degree for the pertaining 
issue and maintaining a mindfulness of the relations at play in the problem. 
The pragmatist seeks to define in terms of specifics, in order to cognitively pave 
the way before actually pursuing the way. This pre-definition is important in 
structuring the possibilities and the possibilities' corresponding decisions 
in a manner superior to resting one's modus operandi purely on the language 
of ideals, the loftiness of this kind of phrasing inconsiderate of the compromises 
and technicalities that are sure to come in real-world decision-making and 
application. Without the ideal, however, the self does not have to share the 
language and symbolism that transcends the self to integrate the vision and 
behavior of others. This could, in turn, prove problematic to the self as an 
agent amongst the collective that requires more than the technical minutiae 
of satisfying details to persist as a body operating under integrity. For 
the self with their self-interest, the dual needs to use the ideal to transcend 
the spatiotemporal mundanity and the pragmatics to set standards and definitions 
for achievement is a constant balancing act that becomes a factor many times 
in relevance, by the demands for empirical performance, to the force of 
self-interest lofty and senseless without the definition of pragmatics and 
ideals.

The difficulty in generalizing self-interest is due, in notable part, to 
the plasticity of human behavior given the cultural landscape and spatiotemporal 
resources available to the self. The connectivities an individual has with their 
surroundings, a great part of these surroundings being the artificial construct 
material or immaterial made by other human beings, demand the individual to 
adapt their styles of expression, to "conform" perhaps, in the same way that 
a puzzle piece must fit with its neighboring puzzle pieces in order to constitute 
the whole. The analogy of the puzzle piece is a gross simplification of the 
complexities that human societies of flux, economically and through other 
aspects of rapid mobilization, are capable of. But the analogy does imply that 
the individual is influenced by their society at large, in any directionality 
of positive (exaggerated) and negative (understated) expression of what their 
will advocates them to do. Those that are in positions of power relative to 
their fellow human being may find the decorum of niceties and endless layers 
of bureaucratic regulation ironically unwholesome because of excess and 
superficiality. These particular individuals, out of their self-interest 
to operate in haste and for immediate results impactful in messaging to others 
of their own power, do not base their actions on the obligation to appease 
and flatter. Other individuals, based on their socio-economic positioning, 
may actually have the same vanities and character flaws as those higher in 
rank to them. These other individuals may also crave power and seek to do 
harm to those disadvantaged. But ultimately, due to their obligation to 
remain fixed at their socio-economic positions, they cannot afford to show 
their faces of wickedness and excess in contradiction by challenge to those 
higher in rank to them. These broad generalizations of how individuals express 
themselves due to their socio-economic status, despite the similarities in 
objectives between their self-interests, is about the human being's utility 
of their available means as well as their constant need to satisfy hierarchical 
expectations, as part of their temperance from excess which may upset the order 
of their society at large. The concept of a "sphere of influence" is of an 
important reminder on the effecting potency of the individual in their preferences. 
The sphere of influence acts as a radius of effective power an individual 
has with respect to their vicinity. Any individual that uses the language of 
ideals to propagate their own vision onto the rest of the world discovers a 
harsh lesson in the reality of constraints that contains them because of the 
spatio-temporal limits, their sphere of influence. Their words of ideals can 
only go so far without there being misinterpretation. Furthermore, their words 
of ideals must manifest themselves in forms of examples instead of the purity 
that is incontrovertible yet also not specified enough to bear actual effect. 
Through paradigms such as the sphere of influence, what one individual believes 
is a selfish intrusion, masquerading under the language of ideals, onto themself 
is according to the definitions of another individual based on their 
self-interest, for the order, that is, the greater good that is for collective 
instead of individual gain. The sphere of influence is an abstract structure that 
allows one individual to impose practices, stemming from their self-interest, and 
another individual to have to abide by those practices. This abstract structure 
is, in effect, one of the cornerstone paradigms for understanding the economizing 
of power according to self-interest, a force that may attempt to supercede in 
relevance of authority to the self-interests of others, or a force that, through 
the pragmatism of utmost consideration for the social construct, drives an 
individual to pretend one way to satisfy their aims of another wanted outcome.

The individual typically likes to project themself as a being of ideals, of 
those things that cannot be so easily quantified and outside of the ordinariness 
of the world's materialization. Regardless of what the individual really believes 
in, the individual that claims to stand by their professed metaphysical bodies 
of ideals is one that cannot be so conveniently rationalized by someone else. 
The ideal stands, is the reason, when all else can crumble because of the material 
impermanence. Stylistic forms of expression the individual takes up, as part of 
their participation in their respective sphere/s of influence, tend to exude 
the ideal, first and foremost, because the ideal is about as fundamental as 
the axiom, yet also serves as a testament to the transcendental nature of the 
individual past their potential of physical impact. The axiom, being an irreducible 
component of the body of natural law, serves as the "root" explanation of all 
natural phenomenon connected to it. The ideal, similarly, is the apex of human 
desire and human conception of infallibility, and thus serves the individual's 
constant need to justify the specifics of their possibly contradictory and 
hypocritical actions; it is the ideal that is fought for, that is to be aspired 
to, and for this to happen, sacrifices in the form of compromise and errors 
are inevitable, so goes the thinking of those that explain themselves in terms 
of their ideals instead of the minutiae of their actions. The sweetest actions, 
the greatest monstrosities throughout history have been committed in the name 
of the ideal. It is as if the ideal is a scientific axiom of objectivity for 
what free will the human has. But truthfully, how much span of free will can the 
human being have if their thoughts and actions are geared towards the ideal, or 
rationalized in retrospect as being for the ideal? This question is tricky to 
answer on the matter of the individual, one with their own self-interest. The 
will of the individual can be simply for justifying the individual by invocation 
of the ideal as the impeccable answer of brevity, instead of genuinely believing in 
the ideal, although the degree of genuine belief in anything, including the 
ideal, is not the only pre-requisite for leading a life instead of having one's 
life misguided by the symbols in practice associated with the ideal. Invocation 
of the ideal is a convenient solution for self-interest: explain away the misdeeds, 
misgivings, and other errors as something confusingly both unavoidable and 
necessary to fulfill the ideal through practice. In the usual course of these 
explanations, it is the practice, after resulting in unideal losses, that 
constitutes the proof of the individual being one with their self-interest 
in parallel support for the ideal.

Self-interest, as already noted, is driven by the individual's will. But there 
are some rather important emotive bodies, not yet explicitly named, that influence 
the will. On the negative end of the spectrum is fear. Fear is a classic irrational 
influencer of the will. Fear causes one, no matter the amount of information they 
have or the experiences they have had, to steer themselves, usually in ways not 
completely uncontrollable by their will, towards routes they have already recognized 
beforehand as decision sequences for the insane. Of course, fear is not an element 
that results in universal outcomes for all those that experience it. Many individuals 
have a seemingly perfect grasp over the influences that fear radiates. But the 
"power", for lack of a more encapsulating term, that fear exerts onto sentient 
cognition is most definitely not null, despite the apparent lack of symptoms the 
individual may express in response to fear. Due to fear, narratives are concocted 
to rationalize the unknown. Since the unknown cannot be properly rationalized because 
knowledge of it lacks in truthful substance, the narratives can only be structured 
to yield answers in the veins of probability or answers that are imprecise due to 
their reliance on metaphorical reasoning. One whose self-interest operates under 
fear is equivalently, one that has decided to de-emphasize their faculty of reason 
to proceed by their preferred answer. The example of the emotive body that is 
fear makes for a comprehensive discussion on the vulnerabilities of those that 
operate purely on their self-interest without the guardrails of default reasoning, 
the only surefire class of decision-making that can yield replicable and rationalizable 
solutions. The force of self-interest, in unrestrained or undisciplined practices, can 
be likened to a rabid animal that has lost its ability to recognize and correct its 
insanity, or to a fiend that has compulsive needs to satisfy their cravings of flesh 
or inanimate substance. A common question, usually asked with great wonder, is how 
someone that operates by their self-interest can make decisions so adverse to their 
livelihood of mind and body, even when there is opportunity of valuable information 
to make better decisions. This question is usually answered by psycho-analytic means, 
especially when there is not enough quantitative information to present explanation 
by the number and the figure. A simple answer rests on how the individual processes 
fear. By believing in the aura that fear radiates into them, the individual closes 
their mind to the outlets that would have granted them greater solution through decisions 
better because the decisions are more informed ones. The will can ward off fear, 
but could just as well let in fear as an influencer variable of the will, practically 
a controller of the will. The actualization of success by an individual with their 
self-interest is oftentimes very dependent on the constituents of their emotive 
state. There is fear that represses. And then there is confidence that motivates 
self-interest to proceed in resistive or forward ways. Both fear and confidence 
are emotive forces that seek to govern the will, by presenting the circumstances 
of unknown or incomplete empirical knowledge as an illusion in the directions 
of positivity (inflation as the willfully ignorant motivator of confidence) and 
negativity (deflation as the repressive fear). In the impartial perspective on 
the utility of emotive forces, such as fear and confidence, self-interest can 
be greatly disserviced by these forces' utility in the long run, where objectivity 
and empiricism yield solutions more durable because of their resting on rational bases, 
instead of the ephemeral power of spontaneity and personal motivation that these two 
emotive forces encourage. However, in the grand scheme of the concept of free will, 
the choice of the individual with their self-interest to rely on the tools of fear and 
confidence, as makers and breakers of the illusions that drive them to act in any 
direction of decision, cannot be truly eradicated. Dictates for self-interest to not 
rely on emotive forces are vain because the choice to let in these forces is an innate 
part of sentient existence; to conclude, sentient thought and action is not confined 
to the rules of stoicism.

The narrative is a powerful tool in relation to self-interest. Such power is factually 
only effective on the cognitive processes of an individual. To clarify though, cognition, 
being the process that yields the first step to any serious thought or action, cannot 
be underestimated or overestimated without there also occurring errors in judgment, 
and judgment gives way to decisions that are impactful to collective perception and 
physical existences. The narrative changes the individual's perception and perspective. 
The reason for this occurrence of cause (the narrative) to effect (the changes onto 
perception and perspective) is simple to understand: the narrative contains centralities 
for cognition to recognize as motives, objectives, and symbols, and those that believe 
in the narrative must also perceive things differently enough to accomodate the persuading 
messages of the narrative. Likewise, the perspective of the believer in the narrative 
also undergoes changes, evidenced by the believer's language used, the ideals they claim 
to now uphold, and the methodologies that they feel they have a right to use, all due 
to the narrative. Some common uses of the narrative are to ascribe constructed objectivity 
to that which otherwise can only be opinionated on given the facts at disposal, to draw 
conclusions on the matters that otherwise can only be speculated on due to the missing 
of vital facts. The narrative fills in the holes of missing information, removes plausible 
sources of doubt, uses language of collective acceptance or traditionalist practice to 
advance points by rational-like expression, and offers direction of morality and action to 
those individuals susceptible to believing the narrative, out of what the individuals 
believe is for the betterment of themselves based on their self-interest, in which 
case their will is for advancing the procedures of reactionary follow-up from the narrative. 
On the use of the narrative for constructive purposes, the self that feels lost or at 
odds with the course of their life's trajectory can be made to accept the realities of 
their situation by the perspective embedded in the narrative they have interpreted as 
fact by their belief. The narrative, for purposes of positive construction, offers 
an explanation through the reality of purported opportunities for the self to 
elevate their stature. There is more than grim facts of details, void of implication 
and causality, that the narrative offers. The narrative can be used to give a sense 
of righteousness to self-interest, that force that is not dependent on scruples to 
operate. The narrative, as a tool of positive construction for the self, instills 
confidence in the self to act by their self-interest, and also to perpetuate fears 
based on the irrationalities of distortion into those adversarial to the self. 
In any complex situation, there are many perspectives that can be formed to 
interpret said situation. The narrative can give a sense of closure to the 
individual that feels torn by the plurality of contradicting interpretation, 
through the details selected in the manner of half-truths and other kinds of 
distortions to validate the individual's sense of their own merit, a positive 
elevator for their self-interest. Because the narrative is not required to be 
based on fact, the narrative could always be constructed to push the perspective 
that suits the desires of the individual's expectations. Without the narrative, 
self-interest has only facts and interpretations gathered from their perception. 
There is still yet the question of the proceeding, the objective that should be 
attempted because of those facts and interpretations. Thus, the narrative removes 
the self's need to continue their contemplation of morality and reason. And without 
any further restraints, the self could very well completely act for the implications 
and means pushed by the narrative, for what they believe is for the best, given 
their self-interest.

There exist strong relations between the social constructs that human beings 
create, based on their acceptances and postulations of social theory, and the 
sphere of influence, how these social constructs operate in radiating manner 
from agents of the social construct onto other agents of the same social construct, 
as well as the narrative, one of the prime tools that spheres of influence use 
to foster belief for what is deemed the appropriate thought and action given a 
world that rests on probabilities and the elevation of one's judgment over the 
judgment of others. The social construct of human understanding, devised and practiced 
by humans, is the apex of human will's conceptualization for order in thought and 
behavior, both of which have freedoms that are not ordered by natural law, instead 
a utility of the constants that comprise natural law. The social construct is what 
gives unifying meaning to phenomenon, for all beings in that construct to participate 
in for equality of belief, that otherwise would be interpreted by an individual 
through their own perception, yielding answers that are subjective in the way of 
opinion to others. Unlike natural phenomena that rests their actualization on the 
constants that comprise natural law, the human being seems to always have a choice 
to think or do some thing. There is a lack of default reason, cause-and-effect that 
is fixed and derived entirely from natural law, in human thought and behavior. In 
fact, oftentimes, the human being, due to their self-interest, commits some action 
that is both costly to themself and damaging to others, but then that same human 
being justifies their action as something within their rights, an expression out 
of their ethics self-professed as necessary, explanations that really cannot be 
rationalized in the manner of propositional logic or calculus as being purely "good", 
as in "optimal", given the resources and the choice available to them. Social values 
are the first thing to be considered in relations between human beings, the most 
frequent aspect to be disagreed upon due to the openness in interpreting the artificial 
axiom, the rule that is not at the same fundamental level as those of natural law 
yet still declared by human societies to be of the same correctness given the social 
construct; the quality of openness in interpreting the artificial axiom is itself 
probably an axiom on par with natural law, due to the many special cases stemming from 
the sheer number of possibilities from spatiotemporal preference in choice. Conventionally, 
any science outside of the fundamental hard sciences (that is what natural law is) 
cannot be anymore than a soft science due to the freedoms of negotiating and 
formulating the rules in ways arbitrary to nature yet seemingly most fitting for 
the belief systems that the corresponding society adheres to. Social constructs, 
especially spheres of influences, are for the purpose of structuring the subjective 
into the belief of fact. But at their default disposal are not the irreducible axioms, 
but rules of relativity and agreeableness. Economic concepts such as zero-sum and 
non-zero sum make themselves very present as ways to form objective and meaning of what 
is right or wrong, given the finite resources and the ever-present disputability of 
actions fallible by preference of one over the other in the context of what 
is universally recognized as vice. Zero-sum decision-making acts as a template for 
justifying the double-standard: doing what would be unequivocally considered wrong 
to one's self or one's group (their sphere of influence) is, on the contrary, 
completely within their rights to inflict upon another, due to such aspects as 
survivalism, in other words, necessary competition such that the higher moral 
principles are forced to be ignored in order to tend to the livelihood of the 
self and their sphere of influence. The narratives that a sphere of influence 
espouses, these same narratives that the self usually also upholds as part of 
their belief system, for their self-interest of course, allow for prioritization 
of certain courses of action and attention (the centralities) that the society 
is to take. The self, always a servant to their self-interest, must always be 
keen on the narratives of the social construct they preside in. The narrative 
is what gives the first impression, by transforming details of mundanity and 
incredulity alike into the image of preferred symbols and morals to be regarded 
in the same vein as natural law, although they are borne from the realm of 
sentient interpretation. The narrative gives the collective unified meanings 
on the infinitessimal grades of information with respect to the situation/s. 
For the individual with their self-interest, there are compromises bound for 
them to participate in, as a stipulation of their membership in the social 
construct that operates synonymously as one or more spheres of influence. 
What is truth for the self then, if the truth goes against the noble lie, 
or the noble's lie? What is "taking the higher road" then, when the agents 
of a social construct have decided to condemn any individual to damnation 
here on planet Earth if the individual were to embark on their "higher road" 
instead of the socially acceptable road? Here in this elaboration on the 
intersection of the social construct, the sphere of influence, and the 
narrative, the individual with their self-interest does not have to be 
a servant only to their self-interest, but also be an agent of plasticity 
for satisfying the social rules of relativity and agreeableness. And the 
self, being one with their self-interest, typically takes up the liberty 
of justifying the compromises they felt forced to make, a stipulation 
of their membership in the social construct, as something optimal and correct 
due to and because of their self-interest.

Reasoning by common sense points to the force of self-interest as the 
metaphysical culprit for a sentient being's selfishness. The sentient 
being, by their self-interest, has the power to act freely within the 
constraints of their spatiotemporal setting. The idea that self-interest 
is a force that naturally leads to one exhibiting selfishness is based, 
first and foremost, on the host of self-interest being that one, the self, 
so that all thought and behavior done by that self can naturally be traced 
back to them, and these efforts are usually to benefit the self out of 
the pragmatic to prioritize the self above others, even in collectivist 
societies, perhaps especially in collectivist societies since no one 
loves the self in these societies as much as the self from their 
self-interest. Selfishness can be understood by the partitioning of 
quantity, between the self and others. The selfish value their views 
above others, and also aspire for power and material value of magnitudes 
disproportionately for them at others' loss. However, if one's self-interest 
is the only factor to consider them as a being that is more selfish than 
not, then claims of their being selfish cannot proceed by any rational 
argument. Self-interest is the force that could give to others as much 
as that to the self. In certain constructs, especially in those that 
operate by non-zero sum, there is actually a pronounced stigmatization 
of those that disproportionately serve themselves over others. The ideal 
in these non-zero sum constructs is that of equal distribution, of fair 
and accurate reciprocity, and of holding the "selfless" act as higher in 
ethical integrity than the selfish act. On the last point of the "selfless" 
act, such labeling seldom goes without there being misconception. The 
"selfless" act is committed by one that still operates by their self-interest. 
The source that is the driving force for a selfless act is the same as that 
of the selfish act, namely self-interest. One way to differentiate an 
action is being selfish as opposed to selfless is by a weighted scheme that 
takes as variables the qualities of reference from said action to the acting 
self. Some variables are easier than others to judge on the spectrum of 
selfless to selfish, such as financial values and material resources. 
Variables that deal with the metaphysical, however, are subject to 
interpretation. For example, one that claims to have conducted an action 
to fulfill their ideal could be classified as being selfless, for they 
took the action for the ideal that exists outside of their sole existence, 
in apparent disregard for their existence. However, if the criteria is that 
one's believed ideals are a part of their self, then one that commits actions 
for what they claim to be for their ideals is selfish by the direct connection 
of fulfilling the ideal being coincidentally efforts to fulfill the self. By 
this strict association of the ideal with the self-interest, the direction of 
gains intended by the self, regardless of any invoked ideal, is towards the 
self. As an example, some human beings find a sense of satisfaction 
in being charitable or empathetic, both of these adjectives being ideals. And 
although the actions that can be labeled charitable or empathetic are not in 
complete reference to the self but to the other, the fact that the self finds 
a sense of satisfaction from the exchange to the other means that the self 
cannot be logically excluded from being categorized as selfish; the ratio  
in preferring the self over the other in acts of charity and empathy seldom 
is ever zero, as in being completely selfless. Such is the fact of sentient 
existence always necessitating a consideration for the self, out of self-interest, 
even in exchanges inarguably more selfless than not. There are inexact 
correlations between the spectrum of selfless to selfish and the spectrum of 
ideal to pragmatic, and as such, every time there is an attempt to categorically 
label an individual as being selfless, void of the attribute of selfishness 
often considered a societal vice, the questions of the involved ideals and 
pragmatics, as influential forces at play in the social construct as well as 
the psyche of the individual, have to also be pondered on for wholesome and 
non-skewed judgment of the individual. In quantitative terms, there is always 
something that could be quantified as a payoff to the self for acting more so 
in the interest of their self or the interest of others, both of these routes' 
efforts spurred by the force of the self's self-interest. The prioritization by 
the self, through thought and action, for their self or for others still bears 
the direct link back to the self. To conclude, the self, through their self-interest, 
does what they feel and think fit, oftentimes. Accurately labeling one as being 
more selfish or more selfless requires the weighted consideration of the pertaining 
variables, but even then, there is room for interpretation that is due not only 
to the whims and objectives of the culture, the collective, but also to the 
individual judges of character. The arguments for a specific one's self-interest 
to be a force for their selfish gain have to remain as subjective notions for 
factual clarity, unless quantification that is complete and accurate in the 
consideration of variables, in the scope of the partitioning between the self and 
the others, takes place. Even so, such quantification for social matters on social 
terms is a matter that takes as precedent in importance the design over the raw 
facts, those details that require interpretation (through the design) for 
labeling by social terms.

Self-deprecation consists of acts by the self, naturally counter-intuitive in 
its rationalization. Why would one place efforts towards debasing their image 
for the perception by others? Take the concept of self-deprecation a few steps 
further in the direction of negativity, and interpretation on that individual 
would quickly shift from their being self-deprecating to their exhibiting a 
self-hatred or a self-loathing. The individual, in their acknowledgment of their 
own mortality and finiteness, would not be naturally inclined by their self-interest 
to deprecate their self. Quantitatively, self-deprecation makes the minor flaw 
into a sort of irreconciliable difference, the near-perfection into the forever 
flawed. Self-deprecation is for alteration of one's image that they want to 
project to the external world, full of other perceptual beings with their 
own perspectives and methods of interpretation. However, the topics of 
self-deprecation seldom rest solely with the one deprecating their self. 
If the insults and mockery of self-deprecation were to be geared entirely against 
the self, then by common sense, any individual that engages in self-deprecation 
would, in fact, be committing assassination of their own character. Despite 
the superficiality of the image individuals and groups attempt to project about 
themselves to others, the image once tarnished is difficult to restore to the 
same degree and nature of idealism before the effacement, especially if the source 
of the effacement persists. Self-deprecation, as something that affects only the 
self that commits it, would not be practical for self-interest. In practice, 
self-deprecation works its effects, not contained only to the self that uses 
it, by appealing to the propensities of others' conceptual identities. The topics of 
self-deprecation are frequently those categorized as the universal concept, 
practiced by virtually all societies structured in some form of socio-economic 
implementation, such as "chivalry", "honor", "honesty", "modesty", "servitude", 
and "status". As such, when one expresses their self-deprecation by these 
universal concepts, it is not only them that is impacted by their insult. The 
thematic broadness of self-deprecation affects all those that abide, in some 
manner of thought and action, to the universal concept that is either alluded 
to or explicitly mentioned. Techniques of self-deprecation propagate effect 
through a few vectors: humor, commonality, and revelation. The indirectness 
of one using self-deprecation to effect insult onto the other/s has certain 
advantages to it. For one, the other that is referenced by the insult does 
not have the basis of substance from the self-deprecating to state that they 
are being insulted without admitting to their faults alluded to. There cannot 
be much opportunity to denounce the self-deprecating as one that "stooped 
low enough" to use ad hominem attacks, for quite literally, the self-deprecating 
are using themselves as the subject of their insults. What insults perceived 
by others are due to their interpretation of reference alluding to their own 
behaviors and way of living, so there must be first acknowledgment from the 
others that the self-deprecating is indirectly portraying them in some negative 
light. Comparatively, the use of ad hominem attacks is conventionally viewed 
as clearly antagonistic due to the qualities of bluntness and sharpness directed 
at some individual or group, thus giving that individual or group logical 
justification to denounce the user of ad hominem as clearly belligerent, clearly 
malicious in spirit of intent. Self-deprecation, besides from being a strategy of 
indirect criticism of the other based on the other's intersection with the 
universal concept that they, according to the self-deprecating, have put into 
grotesque, perverse, and dishonest practice exclusively for their self-interest 
in utter contempt of all else, also acts as an illusory defense for the 
self-deprecating. The self-deprecating, out of their need to maintain the 
appearance of harmlessness (no threat through superiority in quality), uses 
the strategy of self-deprecation. To avoid accusations from others of their 
supposedly egoistic ways, coincidentally and intentionally fallible, the 
self-deprecating insults themselves by way of presenting their conditions 
and circumstances as half-truths (exaggerations, understatements, derogatory 
metaphors) leaning towards the negative light, such as inadequacy and stupidity, 
in order to portray themselves as ones both humble and modest in how they view 
themselves, not in the way of superior status that is often cause for adversarial 
envy.
